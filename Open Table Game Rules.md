# Time Keeping
> “YOU CANNOT HAVE A MEANINGFUL CAMPAIGN IF STRICT TIME RECORDS ARE NOT KEPT.”
> – Gary Gygax, *Dungeon Master’s Guide*

- **For each day that passes in the real world, a day also passes in the game world.** 

- **Expeditions begin on the real world date.** *For example, if we play on June 1st in the real world, then the Party is also starting from June 1st in the game world.*
- **Expedition duration is counted using in-game time.** *Continuing the above example, if the party spends 7 nights on the island before returning home, then that expedition ends on June 8th.*

### Character Lock Down
Characters cannot be played if they are still considered to be on an expedition. Players are welcome and encouraged to have multiple characters. Just choose or make another character to play until your other character gets home!

### Location Lock Down
All locations & hexes visited during an expedititon are unavailable until the end date of that expedition. This prevents continuity ambiguity *(and all the confusion that results from a June 2nd Party killing somebody that the June 1st Party is supposed to talk to on June 3rd lmao).*
