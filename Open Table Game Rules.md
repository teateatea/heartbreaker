# Time Keeping
> “YOU CANNOT HAVE A MEANINGFUL CAMPAIGN IF STRICT TIME RECORDS ARE NOT KEPT.”
> – Gary Gygax, *Dungeon Master’s Guide*

- **For each day that passes in the real world, a day also passes in the game world.** 

- **Expeditions begin on the real world date.** *For example, if we play on June 1st in the real world, then the Party is also starting from June 1st in the game world.*
- **Expedition duration is counted using in-game time.** *Continuing the above example, if the party spends 7 nights on the island before returning home, then that expedition ends on June 8th.*

### Character Lock Down
Characters cannot be played if they are still considered to be on an expedition. Players are welcome and encouraged to have multiple characters. Just choose or make another character to play until your other character gets home!

### Location Lock Down
All locations & hexes visited during an expedititon are unavailable until the end date of that expedition. This prevents continuity ambiguity *(and all the confusion that results from a June 2nd Party killing somebody that the June 1st Party is supposed to talk to on June 3rd lmao).*

# End of Session
The expectation is for the Player Characters to begin, and end, each session at home base. In general, the players should make their way to the coast, signal for a pick up and end the session normally.

##### Escaping the Island!
If characters are still on the island when the session ends, they each must roll on the **Escaping the Island!** table to determine how *(or if)* they got home.

| Escaping the Island!                            | 1d100     |
|:----------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| You don't know where you are.                   | DC 75     |
| You know where you are.                         | DC 50     |
| You have a clear and unhindered path of escape. | DC 25     |
| You are in a coastal hex                        | +10 bonus |

On a failure, roll on the **Failed Escapes** table.  

| 1d10 | Failed Escapes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ---- |:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | You escape unharmed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 2    | You escape but have been permanently altered *(maimed, permanently polymorphed, replaced with a double, etc)*.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 3    | You escape but have been injured. You suffer 1d6 x 1d6 points of damage. If this kills you, see result 10 below.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 4    | You escape, but lost 1d6 random items.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 5    | You got completely lost. This character is unavailable for 1d20 days. At the end of that period, they roll 1d6 on this table before                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 6    | You have been captured, petrified, or otherwise trapped. Roll the escape percentile again to see if your comrades know where you are. If they do not, roll the escape percentile again to see if your comrades have a clue of some sort.                                                                   |
| 7    | You have been transformed into a monster *(undead, lycanthrope, mind controlled, etc)*, and will not be picked up by the ship.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 8    | Opportunity for betrayal. You can choose to either reroll on this table or betray a comrade who would otherwise escape. If you choose to betray a comrade roll 1d6 -- on a roll of 1-4, you escape and they must roll on this table; on a roll of 5-6, both you and your victim suffer the fate they roll. |
| 9    | You have died. Roll the escape percentile again to see if your comrades were able to retrieve your body. If they did not, roll the escape percentile again to see if your comrades know where your body is. If they do not, there is a 50% chance that your body has been utterly destroyed.               |
| 10   | You have died. Roll the escape percentile again to see if your comrades were able to retrieve your body. If they did not, roll the escape percentile again to see if your comrades know where your body is. If they do not, there is a 50% chance that your body has been utterly destroyed.               |

# Sequel Sessions
If the evening is coming to a close, and the party is in the middle of something important, we can plan a sequel session to continue from this point rather than start anew. In order to continue this expedition, *everyone at the table must agree to a date and time within the next 10 days.*

If that session does not happen for any reason, each character must roll on the **Escaping the Island!** table above to determine how *(or if)* they got home.

___
# Arriving Mid-Session
Sometimes players arrive late, that's life. When a new character joins an expedition part way through the session, they roll on the **Where did you come from?** table.

| d12 | Where Did You Come From?                                                                                                                  |
| --- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | You were separated from your original group. You have no rations, haven't eaten in d6 days, and you've lost 1d4 random items.                                        |
| 2   | Yesterday, you survived local fauna, but took 1d6 damage.                                                                                 |
| 3   | You got black-bagged in the night. You could hear raucous laughter and joking, and they dumped you nearby before sunrise. -1 random item. |
| 4   | You walked through an archway in the city, and suddenly found yourself halfway across the island.                                         |
| 5   | You fell through something in the city, and got washed through pipes into the ocean.                                                      |
| 6   | Your companions left you for dead when you got swallowed by something. It regurgitated you within the hour though!                        |
| 7   | You tried to hunt something that you couldn't kill. Your companions were either killed or left behind.                                    |
| 8   | You ran into something *scary*. You fled, and here you are.                                                                               |
| 9   | Your companions got into something they shouldn't have. You didn't make that mistake.                                                     |
| 10  | Your expedition spent time in blue hot springs. You feel great but can't remember where they went. +1 inspiration.                        |
| 11  | You woke up this morning alone. No evidence of your missing partners, but you kept the stuff worth keeping. +1 random item.               |
| 12  | You thought you could do an easy solo mission. You're a little in over your head now, but so far so good. +2 random item.                 |
