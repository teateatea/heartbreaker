## Practical Magic
___
## Spells
*Spells, enchantments, ghosts, and souls are all more or less the same, living creatures ranging widely in strength and intelligence. Wizards train the ability to bind these magical "anima" to their brains: A well-trained brain is a mind-gun loaded with spell-bullets.*

## Spellbooks 
*Spellbooks are arcane menageries, prisons filled with magical spirits.*

<!-- ##### Interactions with other Magic-Users -->
Once a Wizard has Prepared a Spell, that Spell cannot be Cast or Prepared by any Magic-User, until the dawn after the Wizard Casts it. The spell-creature has been bound to the Wizard's soul, and no longer occupies the Spellbook.

Wizards interfere with other Wizards in  this way, but non-Wizard Magic-Users have no effect on the Wizard's ability to Prepare Spells.

<!--~~will be unable to Cast or Prepare that Spell.~~ 

~~canOther Magic-Users will be unable to Cast or Prepare Spells that a Wizard has  has Prepared, or has Cast today.~~

~~However, non-Wizard Casters do not impose this limitation on Wizards.~~ -->

##### Adding Spells to Spellbooks
Assuming a well-stocked magical laboratory, this process is laborious, but largely uncomplicated. Without appropriate facilities, double the duration required.

Make a WIS check vs DC 10. On a success, the following duration is measure in days. On a failure, the following duration is measured in weeks (the Spell resists being bound).

Roll Ld6+INT, and subtract from 20. The result is the number of days/weeks required to add this Spell to the Spellbook. 

## Spell Slots 
*How many spell-creatures can you feed with your soul-energy?*

## Preparing Spells
The Wizard must spend an hour to Prepare Spells from their Spellbook *(usually in the morning)*.





## Casting Spells

##### Cantrips
Parlour tricks 
The Wizard may benefit from minor magical effects related to the spells they have prepared, without actually expelling the spell *(i.e. casually lighting a pipe while Fireball is prepared).*

Cantrips are minor magical effects related to the Spells a Wizard has Prepared. 

The Spells a Wizard has Prepared allows them to produce Cantrips, minor magical effects akin to parlour tricks. These must be related in theme or ability to the Prepared Spell, but are otherwise undefined and the Wizard is free to imagine their own uses:
- A Wizard with *Fireball* Prepared might casually light his pipe. 
- A Wizard with *Rampant Growth* might produce roses for a date.
- A Wizard with 
Cantrips are subject to GM approval, but in general, they are weaker than Spells, and the effects should not require a roll.

#### Conjure Calamity
At any time, a Prepared Spell may be consumed Conjure Calamity, instead of Casting regularly.

### Spell Scrolls
<!--~~Spell Scrolls are akin to individual entries in the Wizard's Spellbook, but are less durable.~~-->Spell Scrolls function identically to Spellbooks, with the following exceptions:
- When Preparing Spells from a Scroll, make an WIS check. On a failure, the Scroll is destroyed.
- When Spontaneous Casting from a Scroll, the Scroll is destroyed.



<!--~~A Prepared Spell may be consumed to cast a Spell from a Spell Scroll. This process takes 10 minutes to Cast safely, and the Spell Scroll becomes available again at the next sunrise (similar to Spellbook Refreshing).~~

~~Alternatively, the Spell Scroll can be cast as an action during combat. A Prepared Spell is consumed in the casting, and the Wizard must Save vs Spells. On a failure, they roll for Spell Catastrophe, and the Scroll is destroyed.~~
-->

## Dangerous Magic
### Death during Casting
If a Wizard dies while Casting a Spell *(regardless of the cause of death)*, immediately roll Spell Catastrophe.

### Spontaneous Casting
*Use this when you have Spell Slots but no time to Prepare!*

*Wizards are unable to safely Cast Spells they have not Prepared. However, some situations call for urgency.* 

A Wizard may Spontaneously Cast a Spell from an available Spellbook or Spell Scroll, consuming either a Spell Slot or a Prepared Spell.

During Casting, the Wizard must Save vs Spells, or suffer a Spell Catastrophe in addition to the intended effects of the Spell. ~~This often includes Conjuring Calamity on themselves.~~ If a Spell Scroll was used, it's destroyed after casting.

#### Over-Preparing
*Use this to when you have no Spell Slots, but you do have time to Prepare.*

*Wizards may be interested in Preparing beyond their ability. This is preferable over Spontaneously Casting, as the process is more of a controlled process.*

While Preparing, the Wizard may Save vs Spells to Prepare an additional Spell. On a failure, roll Spell Catastrophe. The effects of the Spell Catastrophe continue until that Spell is Cast.

#### Over-Casting
*Use this when you have neither Spell Slots, nor time to Prepare.*

Wizard magic is limited by the amount of energy they can safely harvest from the soul. As they progress, they harness can more of this energy, more efficiently.

Spell Slots represent the number of Spells a Wizard can *safely* Cast each day, not the full capacity of their soul. Wizards can keep drawing on their soul's energy to Cast, but risk death in doing so.

At any time, a Wizard may Save vs Death to Spontaneously Cast an available Spell. On a failure, roll Spell Catastrophe in addition to the intended effects of the Spell. (Regardless success or failure, the Wizard then proceeds to Save vs Spells to Spontaneously Cast).

Note that an unlucky Wizard may produce *three* Spell Catastrophes:
1. Failing their Save vs Death to Over-Cast.
2. Failing their Save vs Spells to Spontaneously Cast.
3. Either of the above Spell Catastrophes results in the Wizard's death.
