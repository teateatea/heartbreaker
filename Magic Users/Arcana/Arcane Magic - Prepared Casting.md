*Spells, enchantments, ghosts, and souls are all more or less the same, living creatures ranging widely in strength and intelligence. Wizards train the ability to bind these magical "anima" to their brains: A well-trained brain is a mind-gun loaded with spell-bullets.*

- The Wizard has a Spellbook, from which they Prepare Spells.
- The Wizard has a number of Spell Slots, indicating how many Spells then can safely Prepare each day. <!--%*, indicating how many spell-creatures they can safely feed soul-energy. %Start with 2 rolled, then choose 1 at first level.*-->
- The Wizard must spend an hour to Prepare Spells from their Spellbook *(usually in the morning)*. <!--*temporarily binding the spell-creatures to their brains.*-->
- To Prepare a Spell more than once, the Wizard's Spellbook must contain multiple copies of that Spell. 
	<!-- - % Multiple copies of a spell are required for the wizard to prepare a spell more than once. *(If your spellbook only contains one Light spell-creature, you cannot cast it twice.)*-->
- Once a Prepared Spell is cast, it becomes unavailable until the next dawn *(when the Wizard may again Prepare that Spell from their Spellbook).*
- At any time, a Prepared Spell may be consumed Conjure Calamity, instead of Casting regularly.
- The Wizard may benefit from minor magical effects related to the spells they have prepared, without actually expelling the spell *(i.e. casually lighting a pipe while Fireball is prepared).*
- Wizards cannot Cast Spells they haven't Prepared, but they may Over-Prepare, binding more spells to themselves than their souls can actually feed. *(This carries associated risks.*) See *Over-Preparing*.

### Spells
Spells are spirits, etc.

### Spellbooks 
Spellbooks are arcane menageries, prisons filled with magical spirits.
#### Interactions with other Magic-Users 
Once a Wizard has Prepared a Spell, that Spell cannot be Cast or Prepared by another Magic-Users, until the dawn after the Wizard Casts it.

Wizards interfere with other Wizards in  this way, but non-Wizard Magic-Users have no effect on the Wizard's ability to Prepare Spells.

~~will be unable to Cast or Prepare that Spell.~~ 

~~canOther Magic-Users will be unable to Cast or Prepare Spells that a Wizard has  has Prepared, or has Cast today.~~

~~However, non-Wizard Casters do not impose this limitation on Wizards.~~

### Spell Slots 
How many spell-creatures can you feed with your soul-energy?

### Preparing Spells
The Wizard must spend an hour to Prepare Spells from their Spellbook *(usually in the morning)*.

#### Cantrips
Parlour tricks 
The Wizard may benefit from minor magical effects related to the spells they have prepared, without actually expelling the spell *(i.e. casually lighting a pipe while Fireball is prepared).*

Cantrips are minor magical effects related to the Spells a Wizard has Prepared. 

The Spells a Wizard has Prepared allows them to produce Cantrips, minor magical effects akin to parlour tricks. These must be related in theme or ability to the Prepared Spell, but are otherwise undefined and the Wizard is free to imagine their own uses:
- A Wizard with *Fireball* Prepared might casually light his pipe. 
- A Wizard with *Rampant Growth* might produce roses for a date.
- A Wizard with 
Cantrips are subject to GM approval, but in general, they are weaker than Spells, and the effects should not require a roll.

#### Over-Preparing

### Casting Spells

#### Cantrips

#### Conjure Calamity
At any time, a Prepared Spell may be consumed Conjure Calamity, instead of Casting regularly.

#### Spell Scrolls
A Prepared Spell may be consumed to cast a Spell from a Spell Scroll. This process takes 10 minutes to Cast safely, and the Spell Scroll becomes available again at the next sunrise (similar to Spellbook Refreshing).

Alternatively, the Spell Scroll can be cast as an action during combat. A Prepared Spell is consumed in the casting, and the Wizard must Save vs Spells. On a failure, they roll for Spell Catastrophe, and the Scroll is destroyed.

#### Over-Casting
Wizards are unable to spontaneously Cast Spells they have not Prepared. See *Spell Scrolls* above for a possible alternative.
