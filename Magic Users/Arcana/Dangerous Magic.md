## Death during Casting
If a Wizard dies while Casting a Spell *(regardless of the cause of death)*, immediately roll Spell Catastrophe.

## Spontaneous Casting
***Use this when you have Spell Slots available, but no time to Prepare.***

*Wizards are unable to safely Cast Spells they have not Prepared. However, some situations call for urgency.* 

A Wizard may Spontaneously Cast a Spell from an available Spellbook or Spell Scroll, consuming either a Spell Slot or a Prepared Spell.

During Casting, the Wizard must Save vs Spells, or suffer a Spell Catastrophe in addition to the intended effects of the Spell. ~~This often includes Conjuring Calamity on themselves.~~ If a Spell Scroll was used, it's destroyed after casting.

## Over-Preparing
***Use this to when you have no Spell Slots, but you do have time to Prepare.***

*Wizards may be interested in Preparing beyond their ability. This is preferable over Spontaneously Casting, as the process is more of a controlled process.*

While Preparing, the Wizard may Save vs Spells to Prepare an additional Spell. On a failure, roll Spell Catastrophe. The effects of the Spell Catastrophe continue until that Spell is Cast.

## Over-Casting
*Use this when you have no Spell Slots, and no time to Prepare.*

Wizard magic is limited by the amount of energy they can safely harvest from the soul. As they progress, they harness can more of this energy, more efficiently.

Spell Slots represent the number of Spells a Wizard can *safely* Cast each day, not the full capacity of their soul. Wizards can keep drawing on their soul's energy to Cast, but risk death in doing so.

At any time, a Wizard may Save vs Death to Spontaneously Cast an available Spell. On a failure, roll Spell Catastrophe in addition to the intended effects of the Spell. (Regardless success or failure, the Wizard then proceeds to Save vs Spells to Spontaneously Cast).

Note that an unlucky Wizard may produce *three* Spell Catastrophes:
1. Failing their Save vs Death to Over-Cast.
2. Failing their Save vs Spells to Spontaneously Cast.
3. Either of the above Spell Catastrophes results in the Wizard's death.
