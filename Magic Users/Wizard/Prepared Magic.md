[[Wizard]] | [[Prepared Magic]] | [[Dangerous Magic]]
___
## Spells
*Spells, enchantments, ghosts, and souls are all more or less the same, living creatures ranging widely in strength and intelligence. Wizards train the ability to bind these magical "anima" to their brains: A well-trained brain is a mind-gun loaded with spell-bullets.*
___
## Spellbooks 
*Spellbooks are arcane menageries, prisons filled with magical spirits.*

<!-- ##### Interactions with other Magic-Users -->


<!--~~will be unable to Cast or Prepare that Spell.~~ 

~~canOther Magic-Users will be unable to Cast or Prepare Spells that a Wizard has  has Prepared, or has Cast today.~~

~~However, non-Wizard Casters do not impose this limitation on Wizards.~~ -->

##### Adding Spells to Spellbooks
Assuming a well-stocked magical laboratory, this process is laborious, but largely uncomplicated. Without appropriate facilities, double the duration required.

Make a WIS check vs DC 10. On a success, the following duration is measure in days. On a failure, the following duration is measured in weeks (the Spell resists being bound).

Roll Ld6+INT, and subtract from 20. The result is the number of days/weeks required to add this Spell to the Spellbook. 
___
## Spell Slots 
*How many spell-creatures can you feed with your soul-energy?*
___
## Preparing Spells
The Wizard must spend an hour to Prepare Spells from their Spellbook *(usually in the morning)*.

*See [[Dangerous Magic#Over-Preparing|Over-Preparing]] for Preparing without Spell Slots.*<br>*See [[Dangerous Magic#Spontaneous Casting|Spontaneous Casting]] for Casting without Preparing.*

##### Empty Spellpages
*The spell-creature has been bound to the Wizard's soul, and no longer occupies the Spellbook.*

Once a Wizard has Prepared a Spell, that Spell cannot be Cast or Prepared by any Magic-User, until the dawn after the Wizard Casts it. Wizards interfere with other Wizards in this way, but non-Wizard Magic-Users have no effect on the Wizard's ability to Prepare Spells.


___
## Casting Spells
*See [[Dangerous Magic#Spontaneous Casting|Spontaneous Casting]] for Casting without Preparing.*<br>*See [[Dangerous Magic#Over-Casting|Over-Casting]] for Casting without Spell Slots.*

##### Cantrips
Parlour tricks 
The Wizard may benefit from minor magical effects related to the spells they have prepared, without actually expelling the spell *(i.e. casually lighting a pipe while Fireball is prepared).*

Cantrips are minor magical effects related to the Spells a Wizard has Prepared. 

The Spells a Wizard has Prepared allows them to produce Cantrips, minor magical effects akin to parlour tricks. These must be related in theme or ability to the Prepared Spell, but are otherwise undefined and the Wizard is free to imagine their own uses:
- A Wizard with *Fireball* Prepared might casually light his pipe. 
- A Wizard with *Rampant Growth* might produce roses for a date.
- A Wizard with *example here.*

Cantrips are subject to GM approval, but in general, they are weaker than Spells, and the effects should not require a roll.

##### Conjure Calamity
At any time, a Prepared Spell may be consumed Conjure Calamity, instead of Casting regularly.

##### Spell Scrolls
<!--~~Spell Scrolls are akin to individual entries in the Wizard's Spellbook, but are less durable.~~-->Spell Scrolls function identically to Spellbooks, with the following exceptions:
- When Preparing Spells from a Scroll, make an WIS check. On a failure, the Scroll is destroyed.
- When Spontaneous Casting from a Scroll, the Scroll is destroyed.



<!--~~A Prepared Spell may be consumed to cast a Spell from a Spell Scroll. This process takes 10 minutes to Cast safely, and the Spell Scroll becomes available again at the next sunrise (similar to Spellbook Refreshing).~~

~~Alternatively, the Spell Scroll can be cast as an action during combat. A Prepared Spell is consumed in the casting, and the Wizard must Save vs Spells. On a failure, they roll for Spell Catastrophe, and the Scroll is destroyed.~~
-->
___
## Spell Catastrophes
*Something has gone wrong while you were using magic.*
