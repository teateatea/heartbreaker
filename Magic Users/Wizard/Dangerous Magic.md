## Death during Casting
If a Wizard dies while Casting a Spell *(regardless of the cause of death)*, immediately roll Spell Catastrophe.

## Spontaneous Casting
**Use this when you have Spell Slots available, but no time to Prepare.**

*Wizards are unable to safely Cast Spells they have not Prepared. However, some situations call for urgency.* 

As a full round action, a Wizard may Spontaneously Cast an available Spell from a Spellbook or Spell Scroll, consuming either a Spell Slot or a Prepared Spell. The Wizard must **Save vs Spells**, or suffer a Spell Catastrophe in addition to the intended effects of the Spell. <!--~~This often includes Conjuring Calamity on themselves.~~--> If a Spell Scroll was used, it's destroyed after casting.

## Over-Preparing
**Use this to when you have no Spell Slots, but you do have time to Prepare.**

*Wizards may be interested in Preparing beyond their ability. This is preferable to Spontaneously Casting, as this process is somewhat more controlled.*

While Preparing, the Wizard may **Save vs Spells** to Prepare a Spell *without* an available Spell Slot. On a failure, roll Spell Catastrophe. There is a 50% chance the effects of the Spell Catastrophe end *(or are reversed)* when that Spell is Cast.

## Over-Casting
**Use this when you have no Spell Slots, and no time to Prepare.**

<!--*Wizard magic is limited by the amount of energy they can safely harvest from the soul. As they progress, they harness can more of this energy, more efficiently.*
-->
*Spell Slots represent the number of Spells a Wizard can safely Cast each day, not the full capacity of their soul. Wizards can keep drawing on their soul's energy to Cast, but risk death in doing so.*

As a full round action, a Wizard may **Save vs Death** to Spontaneously Cast an available Spell from a Spellbook or Spell Scroll, without using an available Spell Slot. On a failure, roll Spell Catastrophe in addition to the intended effects of the Spell. 

The Wizard then proceeds to **Save vs Spells** to Spontaneously Cast, as above.

*Note that a very unlucky Wizard could produce three Spell Catastrophes:*
1. By failing their Save vs Death to Over-Cast.
2. By also failing their Save vs Spells to Spontaneously Cast.
3. If either of the above Spell Catastrophes result in the Wizard's death.
