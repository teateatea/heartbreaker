# Optional Rule - Tough Minions
*See also:* 
___
Minions of a higher challenge rating, such as abyssal ghouls or fire giants, make powerful foes. Consequently, it could break the game’s verisimilitude for an NPC commoner to kill such a minion with a single attack. To keep minions believable, you can use the following rule.

When a minion’s challenge rating is at least 6 higher than an NPC’s challenge rating, that NPC’s actions and traits affect a minion as if they didn’t have the Minion trait, reducing the minion’s hit points like a normal creature instead of automatically dropping them to 0.

This rule shouldn’t be applied to player characters—they’re heroes who can always kill a minion in one hit.

### Special Traits
Many minions have traits that give them strength in numbers but become less powerful as their allies are defeated. For example, an enemy that starts their turn within 5 feet of three or more goblin minions must succeed on a saving throw or take damage from Tiny Stabs.

### Challenge Ratings
Minions have a challenge rating just like any other creature. However, their experience point value is one-fifth that of a standard creature of the same challenge rating. Aside from their damage output and the Minion trait, a minion’s statistics are on par with a creature of the same challenge rating.

When the rules reference a challenge rating, such as the polymorph spell or the cleric’s Destroy Undead feature, use the minion’s listed challenge rating as normal. For instance, a 5th-level cleric can affect Undead creatures with a challenge rating of 1/2 or lower with their Destroy Undead feature—so this feature can affect zombie minions (CR 1/4) but not specter minions (CR 1).
