*Minions are weak creatures that find strength in numbers.*

### Summary
- No Hit Dice (HD).
- Static damage *(don't roll for damage)*.
- Minions of the same type act on the same turn.
---
- When minions take any damage from an attack, or from a failed saving throw, they are reduced to 0 HP.
- When minions take any damage equal or higher than their Max HP, they are reduced to 0 HP.
- Any other damage is ignored.
---
- 2-5 minions can be grouped.
- Minions may make a group attack: $M$ minions make one attack with a +$M$ bonus, then deal their damage $\times$  $M$. *(4 goblin minions roll 1d20 + 4 to hit, then deal 1 $\times$ 4 damage.)*
- Minions may make group saves: All minions in the group take the same result.

# Minions
Minions are weak foes that allow GMs to create dramatic combat encounters with hordes of enemies without overwhelming the characters. In fact, an encounter with minions makes characters feel heroic, since they can take on a myriad of foes and live to tell the tale.

However, minions still make threatening foes. Killing a minion still requires penetrating their defenses, and characters can’t just shrug off damage from minion attacks.

So how do minions make running a horde of enemies quick and easy for the GM?
- Minions are simple to run. Their stat blocks are small and uncomplicated.
-  Minions act quickly. They don’t multiattack, roll for damage, or take bonus actions or reactions, so their turns aren’t long.
- Minions die fast. A character can kill several minions with a single weapon attack!
- Minions have strength in numbers. Their attacks can be grouped together to make them deadlier and faster to use at the table.

### No Hit Dice
Minions have hit points but no Hit Dice, simplifying their design. Minions can’t spend Hit Dice to heal during a short rest because they have none.

### No Damage Rolls
Minions don’t roll for damage because their attacks deal a static amount of damage. They also can’t score critical hits.

### Shared Turns
Typically, all minions of the same stat block act on the same turn. Since they share a turn, the minions can each move into position then each use an action if they wish, instead of each moving and taking an action individually.

### Minion Trait
Every minion has the Minion trait, which affects the creature in the following ways:
- If the minion takes any damage from an attack or as the result of a failed saving throw, their hit points are reduced to 0.
- If the minion takes damage from another effect, they die if the damage equals or exceeds their hit point maximum, otherwise they take no damage.

title: Behind the Design: Minion Trait
collapse: open
You might ask, why not just give minions 1 hit point and take no damage when they save for half, like in fourth edition? First, spells that use a creature’s hit points to determine effectiveness—like color spray and sleep—would devastate all minions, even those meant to challenge high-level characters. These spells are still effective against minions, just not devastating!

Second, spells and effects that deal damage without any attack roll or save—like magic missile and spike growth—would lay waste to minions with 1 hit point. This fits the fiction for minions with low challenge ratings, like goblins and zombies.
But the balance of combat and fiction breaks down to near-silliness at higher levels when the same spells easily take down powerful devil minions.

Finally, high-level spells with a save for half damage—like fireball or meteor swarm—would feel wasted against minions with 1 hit point. Why use a higher-level spell when a lower-level one will do? Similarly, the fourth edition design could lead to a kobold minion illogically surviving a fireball spell while a “stronger” standard kobold next to them dies, despite both creatures succeeding on their saving throw. By contrast, under this book’s minion rules, spellcasters still have a good reason to use high-level spells against minions.

# Overkill Attacks
Powerful weapon attacks can kill more than one minion in a single maneuver called an **overkill attack**.

As already discussed, a weapon attack requires only 1 point of damage to reduce a minion to 0 hit points, regardless of their hit point maximum. However, when a weapon attack’s damage does exceed the target minion’s hit point maximum, the attack becomes an overkill attack and the damage dealt beyond the minion’s hit point maximum becomes overkill damage.

Overkill damage can be applied to a second minion that has the same stat block as the target and is in overkill range (see below). Damage against the second minion is counted as if you made a weapon attack against them; since it only takes 1 point of weapon damage to reduce a minion to 0 hit points, any amount of overkill damage immediately knocks them out. But wait, it gets better—if the initial attack’s overkill damage exceeds the second minion’s hit point maximum, the leftover overkill damage can roll over to a third minion, and so on! In other words, for each time the overkill damage exceeds the new target’s hit point maximum, the attacker can choose an additional minion to reduce to 0 hit points.

For example, when a weapon attack deals 18 damage to a minion with a hit point maximum of 5, the overkill damage is 13. If there are three additional minions of the same stat block in overkill range, they can all three be immediately reduced to 0 hit points, since the overkill damage exceeded the target’s hit point maximum more than twice over.

Overkill attacks can’t be made as part of an opportunity attack.

##### Overkill Range
Minions must be within a certain range to qualify for an overkill attack, determined by whether the attack is a melee or ranged attack.

***Melee Overkill Attacks.*** When a creature hits a minion with a melee weapon attack, other minions within reach of the attack are in overkill range and can be chosen as additional targets for an overkill attack. The overkill attack can’t target minions outside the weapon attack’s reach.

*Lady Ulnock the paladin battles a horde of goblin minions (each with 6 hit points). She hits a goblin minion with her longsword and uses Divine Smite, dealing 8 slashing damage and 11 radiant damage to the target for a total of 19 damage. Since Lady Ulnock dealt 13 points of overkill damage—more than the hit point maximum of two additional minions—she can choose up to three additional goblin minions within 5 feet of her (the reach of her longsword attack) and reduce them to 0 hit points. If there are no other goblin minions within 5 feet of Lady Ulnock, she can’t damage additional minions with this attack.*

***Ranged Overkill Attacks.*** When a creature hits a minion with a ranged weapon attack, other minions in a line originating from the creature in the direction of the target, to a distance equal to the weapon’s short range, are in overkill range and can be chosen as additional targets for an overkill attack. The overkill attack can’t target minions outside the line or beyond the weapon’s short range.

*Perigold Quickfingers the rogue is hidden and takes aim at a group of zombie minions (each with 6 hit points) with his light crossbow (which has a short range of 80 feet). He hits a zombie minion with his crossbow, dealing extra damage thanks to his Sneak Attack, for a total of 14 damage. Since Perigold dealt 8 points of overkill damage—more than the hit point maximum of one additional minion—he can choose up to two additional zombie minions in an 80-foot-long line extending from Perigold in the direction of the target, reducing them to 0 hit points. If there are no other zombie minions in the line, then Perigold can’t damage other minions with this attack.*

# Group Attacks
Each minion has a group attack action that speeds up play. In a group attack, two to five minions of the same stat block that share a turn can all use their action to take the same action and attack one target, provided the target is within the attack’s reach or range for each minion.
- Make a single attack roll for the group attack. It counts as one attack.
- A group attack roll gains a +1 bonus to the attack roll for every minion in the attack. (For example, if four goblin minions make a group attack together, the attack roll gains a +4 bonus.)
- If the group attack hits, multiply the damage by the number of minions that made the group attack. (For example, if four goblin minions hit with a group attack that deals 1 damage, their group attack deals 4 damage.)

The GM decides how many minions participate in a group attack. For instance, if five minions surround a target, the GM may decide to have all five attack at once to speed up combat, or may break up the attacks among smaller groups in order to increase the odds that some minions hit while others miss. A single minion can even use their group attack action on their own—they make the attack as a normal creature would, and simply don’t benefit from any group bonuses.

##### Advantage and Disadvantage
A group attack is only made with advantage or disadvantage if all the minions making the group attack have advantage or disadvantage on the attack roll. Otherwise, the attack is made without advantage or disadvantage.

##### Target Response Effects
If a group attack triggers a reaction or similar effect that would normally affect a single attacker, such as the fire shield or hellish rebuke spell, the target of the group attack picks one minion that was part of the attack to be affected by the effect.

##### Group Opportunity Attacks
If a creature provokes an opportunity attack from more than one minion of the same stat block at a time and those minions have a melee group attack action, the minions can each use their reaction to make a group attack as an opportunity attack.

### Optional Rule: Group Saves ✅
Though minions often make saving throws individually, there are times when rolling individual saves for each minion could slow down the action, like when a cleric surrounded by eighteen specter minions uses Turn Undead.

When many minions with the same stat block need to make a saving throw against the same effect at the same time, you can make one saving throw for a group of up to five
minions at a time. All minions in a group use the result of the saving throw.

For instance, if thirty-four goblin minions need to make a saving throw against a hypnotic pattern spell, the minions would make a total of seven saving throws against the spell: six for thirty minions divided into six groups of five, and one more save for the remaining group of four minions.

### Optional Rule: Tough Minions
Minions of a higher challenge rating, such as abyssal ghouls or fire giants, make powerful foes. Consequently, it could break the game’s verisimilitude for an NPC commoner to kill such a minion with a single attack. To keep minions believable, you can use the following rule.

When a minion’s challenge rating is at least 6 higher than an NPC’s challenge rating, that NPC’s actions and traits affect a minion as if they didn’t have the Minion trait, reducing the minion’s hit points like a normal creature instead of automatically dropping them to 0.

This rule shouldn’t be applied to player characters—they’re heroes who can always kill a minion in one hit.

### Special Traits
Many minions have traits that give them strength in numbers but become less powerful as their allies are defeated. For example, an enemy that starts their turn within 5 feet of three or more goblin minions must succeed on a saving throw or take damage from Tiny Stabs.

### Challenge Ratings
Minions have a challenge rating just like any other creature. However, their experience point value is one-fifth that of a standard creature of the same challenge rating. Aside from their damage output and the Minion trait, a minion’s statistics are on par with a creature of the same challenge rating.

When the rules reference a challenge rating, such as the polymorph spell or the cleric’s Destroy Undead feature, use the minion’s listed challenge rating as normal. For instance, a 5th-level cleric can affect Undead creatures with a challenge rating of 1/2 or lower with their Destroy Undead feature—so this feature can affect zombie minions (CR 1/4) but not specter minions (CR 1).

### Building Minion Encounters
Minions present opportunities for memorable, cinematic encounters. Keep the following tips in mind to achieve maximum fun while planning and running combat encounters with minions.
##### Encounter Difficulty
When building encounters against a single foe, the core rules advise matching the characters with a creature whose CR is close to the average party level. What happens when you add minions to the mix?

Remember that a minion is worth only a fifth of the experience points of normal creatures of that challenge rating. Similarly, when building encounters, five minions count as just one creature for the purpose of calculating encounter difficulty.

Unlike standard creatures, it’s difficult for a group of minions to challenge characters if their challenge rating is at least 2 lower than the average party level. In general, avoid
using such minions unless you want to build a trivial combat encounter. You can increase a minion’s challenge rating using the rules in Modifying and Making Minions.

##### Tell Your Players
While it’s tempting to pit your unsuspecting players against a horde of fire giants just to watch their eyes pop out of their faces in surprise, minion encounters are more fun overall if you share the rules for minions with your players before they get into an encounter. They’ll understand how overkill and group attacks work, spend their resources more 
 efficiently, and be able to help you track the fight more easily, which is worth a lot more than the shock value of a sea of foes the players don’t know are minions.
 
If you want the best of both worlds, end a session with the characters confronting a horde f creatures before rolling initiative. At the start of the next session, reveal those creatures are minions and share the rules.

##### Not Too Many
When you’re planning your encounters, think of five minions as one creature. While it might be exciting to throw a hundred minions at the characters, that’s like them facing twenty standard creatures. It can be done and might even be fun, but it’s not the typical minion experience and results in a much longer battle than normal. Keep the following tips in mind when adding minions to an encounter:
- When the characters are 10th level or lower, most encounters work well with ten to twenty minions in addition to other creatures.
- When the characters are 11th level or higher, they’re more efficient at killing minions, and many of the poor critters will die before they even act. Most high-level encounters work well with twenty to thirty minions.
- If you find mid-battle that minions are dying too quickly to present a challenge, you can have reinforcements join the fray.

##### Add Standard Creatures
Minion encounters become more dynamic if you add some standard creatures allied with the minions. A hag coven surrounded by ogre minions or a red dragon tyrant commanding
fire giant minions present more interesting encounters than copies of the same enemy, challenging the characters to use diverse tactics.

##### Cut the Choke Points
Since minions are most effective in numbers, avoid encounters in cramped dungeon tunnels and similar choke points. Combat becomes dull in tight quarters if only a couple minions can attack at a time.

### Modifying and Making Minions
You can increase a minion’s challenge rating or create new minions using the Minion Statistics by Challenge Rating table. To change an existing minion’s challenge rating, adjust their proficiency bonus, hit points, and damage dealt by their attacks. If a minion’s proficiency bonus changes, their AC, attack bonuses, and the DC for ability checks and saving throws made to resist the minion’s traits and actions modifier, consider giving the creature natural armor that grants a bonus to AC equal to their proficiency bonus. The table is merely a guide—feel free to tweak the math to get the specific minion you desire.

```ad-note
title: Minion Bands
collapse: open
A combat encounter with more than five minions per character can become deadly if all minions act on the same turn. The characters cut down minion hordes on their turns but then suffer massive damage as a sea of minions pour down on them. While many groups like this challenge, you have the option to divide the minions into different bands that act on different initiative counts. If you do this, minions can only join group attacks with minions in the same band. At the start of a new round, two or more bands of minions can reorganize into one band, acting on the lowest initiative count of the bands that combined.

If you divide minions into bands, be sure to distinguish which minions belong together. For gridded combat, you could use a colored marker for each miniature, or in a theater of the mind encounter, try group descriptors like “zombie dwarves” and “zombie elves.”
