# Minions
Minions are weak foes that allow GMs to create dramatic combat encounters with hordes of enemies without overwhelming the characters. In fact, an encounter with minions makes characters feel heroic, since they can take on a myriad of foes and live to tell the tale.

However, minions still make threatening foes. Killing a minion still requires penetrating their defenses, and characters can’t just shrug off damage from minion attacks.

So how do minions make running a horde of enemies quick and easy for the GM?
- Minions are simple to run. Their stat blocks are small and uncomplicated.
-  Minions act quickly. They don’t multiattack, roll for damage, or take bonus actions or reactions, so their turns aren’t long.
- Minions die fast. A character can kill several minions with a single weapon attack!
- Minions have strength in numbers. Their attacks can be grouped together to make them deadlier and faster to use at the table.

### No Hit Dice
Minions have hit points but no Hit Dice, simplifying their design. Minions can’t spend Hit Dice to heal during a short rest because they have none.

### No Damage Rolls
Minions don’t roll for damage because their attacks deal a static amount of damage. They also can’t score critical hits.

### Shared Turns
Typically, all minions of the same stat block act on the same turn. Since they share a turn, the minions can each move into position then each use an action if they wish, instead of each moving and taking an action individually.

### Minion Trait
Every minion has the Minion trait, which affects the creature in the following ways:
- If the minion takes any damage from an attack or as the result of a failed saving throw, their hit points are reduced to 0.
- If the minion takes damage from another effect, they die if the damage equals or exceeds their hit point maximum, otherwise they take no damage.

##### *Behind the Design: Minion Trait*
You might ask, why not just give minions 1 hit point and take no damage when they save for half, like in fourth edition? First, spells that use a creature’s hit points to determine effectiveness—like color spray and sleep—would devastate all minions, even those meant to challenge high-level characters. These spells are still effective against minions, just not devastating!

Second, spells and effects that deal damage without any attack roll or save—like magic missile and spike growth—would lay waste to minions with 1 hit point. This fits the fiction for minions with low challenge ratings, like goblins and zombies.
But the balance of combat and fiction breaks down to near-silliness at higher levels when the same spells easily take down powerful devil minions.

Finally, high-level spells with a save for half damage—like fireball or meteor swarm—would feel wasted against minions with 1 hit point. Why use a higher-level spell when a lower-level one will do? Similarly, the fourth edition design could lead to a kobold minion illogically surviving a fireball spell while a “stronger” standard kobold next to them dies, despite both creatures succeeding on their saving throw. By contrast, under this book’s minion rules, spellcasters still have a good reason to use high-level spells against minions.
