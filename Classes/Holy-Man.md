### Holy-Man Level Progression
| Level | XP    | HD  | AB  |     |  D  |  W  |  P  |  B  |  S  |
|:----- |:----- |:--- |:--- | --- |:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 1     | 0     | 1d6 | +0  |     | 11  | 12  | 14  | 16  | 15  |
| 2     | 1,500 | 2d6 | +0  |     | 11  | 12  | 14  | 16  | 15  |
| 3     | 3,000 | 3d6 | +0  |     | 11  | 12  | 14  | 16  | 15  |

### Combat
Holy-Men can only wield daggers, and are unable to use Invocations while using Shields or wearing any kind of Armour. This makes them very vulnerable in combat.

Some Sacred Traditions include Combat training, and will specify the additional weapons a Holy-Man may wield, or the Armour they may wear.

### Sacred Tradition
Sacred Traditions are the basis of the Holy-Man's power: Religions, deities, or otherworldly beings that grant wishes and miracles.

At first level, choose any Tradition associated with your Culture or Ancestry. If you don't want to choose an established Tradition, you can work with the DM to create your own.

| **Maroi**   | [[Saint Acobi\|Acobi, the One True Saint]]                           | -                                               |                            |
|             | [[The Old Gods of Maroi]]                                            | -                                               |                            |
| **Caspian** | [[Caspian Natural Gods\|The Caspian Natural Gods]]                   | -                                               |                            |

|             |                                                                      | [[Mystic of Dunastra\|Dun Astra, the Wanderer]] | Travel, Fate, & Cunning    |
| **Mur**     | [[The Restless Kaghan]]                                              | ([[Noita - Mura Mage\|Noita]])                  | Nature & Spirits                           |


### Magic
The Liturgies of most Sacred Traditions produce similar outcomes to Magic Spells, but Holy-Men themselves do not have inherent magical abilities. They do not have Spell Slots, and cannot activate Magic Items.[^1]

<!--Those wishing to personally cast Magic need to [[Multiclassing|Multiclass]] as a [[Magic-User]], which progresses more slowly than specializing.

Players looking for a [[Warlock]] class should begin here. Deities can choose a Champion, but only with an goal in mind, and many exact a price.-->

<!-- #Revisit Warlocks still gather favour, and can use favour to a) Refresh their Spell Slots. b) Create new Spell Slots c) Use Invocations d) -->
