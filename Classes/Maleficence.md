## Maleficence
___
**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Target:** All adjacent creatures, or one visible creature
**[[Spell Ranges|Range]]:** 150'
**Damage:** $MD$ 

Mana Dice may be rolled to cast Maleficence upon your foes.

- **Targets:** The maleficence unerringly hits all adjacent creatures, or a single visible target within range *(no attack roll or saving throw is required).*
- **Damage:** The Mana Dice used to cast this spell also determine damage.
- **Discordant Harmony:** If all dice come up as 6, roll another Mana Die and add it to the total, continuing this procedure as long as 6's are rolled or until all your Mana Dice are spent.
- **Unique:** Each Maestro's maleficence is unique and should be determined at the time of character creation by the choice of a single additional descriptor *(fire, lightning, shadow, cold, acid, etc).* This can also cause secondary effects when appropriate *(igniting flammable objects, freezing a small pool, etc).*

# Original Text in [[Wonder & Wickedness]]
##### p.5
Any prepared spell may be expended to conjure calamity, doing two dice ofdamage to all in a melee area or to a single enemy. A saving throw is allowed for half damage.

Each sorcerer's maleficence is unique and should be determined at the time ofcharacter creation by the choice of a single additional descriptor (fire, lightning, shadow, cold, acid, and so forth), which can also cause appropriate secondary effects (perhaps igniting flammable objects, freezing a small pool, or doing extra situational damage based on enemy weaknesses).

When both damage dice come up 6, roll another die and add it to the total, continuing this procedure as long as sixes are rolled. Maleficence gives sorcerers a default potent magical attack option that nonetheless is not without resource considerations (given that a prepared spell must be sacrificed).
