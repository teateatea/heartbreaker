### Combat
Magic-Users can only wield Daggers, and are unable to cast Spells while using Shields or wearing any kind of Armour. This makes them very vulnerable in combat.

### Paradigms
Arcane Paradigms describe the various methods to learn magic, and are generally divided by country or ancestry. At first level, Magic-Users may choose the Paradigm associated with either their Culture, or their Ancestry.

| Origin     | Paradigm                                                             |     |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | --- |
| **Tor**    | [[Wizard]]                                                           | Wizards study the [[Principia Arcana]], the most advanced paradigm taught by the Torian [[Phandalin Schola Legio Arcana (PSLA)\|Schola Legio Arcana]]. Their spells are a menagerie of diverse spell-creature-bullets, bound and controlled by the soul.    |
| **Maroi**  | [[Maroian Magicians\|Magician]]                                      |     |
| **Caspia** | [[Caspian Maestros\|Maestro]]                                        |     |
| **Mur**    | [[Seiðkona - Murian Mages\|Seiðkona]] / [[Noita - Mura Mage\|Noita]] |     |

Magic-Users can generally learn Spells based in other Paradigms without issue, so they rarely study Paradigms outside their own. If they do, this is treated as [[Multiclassing|Multiclassing]], which progresses more slowly than specializing.
