[[home|Home]] | **Specialist**
___
*Fighters are adventurers because they are so inured to death that they cannot settle down to a normal life. Magic-Users are those that have pursued the dark arts and are no longer welcome in society. Clerics are charged by their god to go forth and perform their special duties.*

***Specialists**? They do it because they want to. Whether inspired by greed, boredom, or idle curiosity, Specialists are professional explorers risking life and limb simply because a less active life is distasteful to them. In some ways this makes them the only sane and normal adventuring characters, but in other ways it makes them the most unusual.*

### Combat
Specialists are not proficient with armour heavier than leather, nor with shields. They can use any weapon.

### Skill Points
The Specialist is unique because the character class has no special abilities of its own. Instead, a Specialist is better at certain activities that all characters are able to do at a basic level. The Specialist begins at the same default level in these activities as other characters, but receives “points” which can be allocated to improve his ability in the chosen skills. The available skills (and their default starting values for all characters) are:

- 1-in-6: Architecture [[Link]]
- 1-in-6: Bushcraft [[Link]]
- 1-in-6: **[[Hazards and Challenges#Climbing|Climb Sheer Surfaces]]**

- 1-in-6: Languages [[Link]]
- 1-in-6: Open Doors [[Link]]
- 1-in-6: Search [[Skill]]
- 1-in-6: Sleight of Hand [[Skill]]

- ×1: [[Specialist#Sneak Attack|Sneak Attack]]
- 1-in-6: Stealth [[Skill]]
- 1-in-6: Tinker [[Skill]]

Most of the rules covering these skills can be found in the Adventuring: Rules of the Game section of this book.

The scope of these skills in described below.

For skills that are “1-in-6”, allocating a point increases the chance by one. For example, Languages begins at 1-in-6. A Specialist allocating a point to this skill increases his chance to 2-in-6.
### Skills
When use of an ability is attempted, the player must roll d6 and if the result is equal to, or less than the ability, the action is successful. In some cases the Referee will make the roll if the character would not immediately know if he was successful. For example, the character will easily be able to tell if he has successfully picked a lock or not, so the player can make that roll. On the other hand, the character would not know, after searching for traps, if he has failed to find a trap or if there simply is not one present. In this case, the Referee will make that roll.

If a Specialist has a skill with a rating of 6 in 6, the roll to succeed is made with two dice, and only if both dice come up 6 does the attempt fail. The Specialist must be unencumbered to use any of the class abilities involving movement or suffer a one point skill penalty per level of encumbrance. They must have 
Specialist Tools (see Equipment section) to use Search for finding traps or to use Tinker for opening locks or other such activities.

### Thief Skills
Thieves can use the following skills, with the chance of success shown opposite:
##### Architecture
##### Bushcraft
##### Climb
- Climb sheer surfaces (CS): A roll is required for each 100’ to be climbed. If the roll fails, the thief falls at the halfway point, suffering falling damage.

##### Language
###### Read Languages Probably Cut
A thief of 4th level or higher can read non-magical text in any language (including dead languages and basic codes) with 80% probability. If the roll does not succeed, the thief may not try to read that particular text again before gaining an experience level.

##### Search\*
- Hear noise (HN): In a quiet environment (e.g. not in combat), a thief may attempt to listen at a door or to hear the sounds of something (e.g. a wandering monster) approaching.
- The referee should roll for hear noise, hide in shadows, and move silently on the player’s behalf, as the thief does not immediately know if the attempt was successful. If a hide in shadows or move silently roll fails, the referee knows that the thief has been noticed and should determine enemies’ actions appropriately.

##### Sleight of Hand
- Pick pockets (PP): If the victim is above 5th level, the thief ’s roll is penalised by 5% for every level above 5th. There is always at least a 1% chance of failure. A roll of more than twice the percentage required for success means that the attempted theft is noticed. The referee should determine the reaction of the victim (possibly using the reaction table under Encounters, p124).

##### Sneak Attack
For other characters, Sneak Attacks are merely attacks made by surprise. A Specialist can multiply the damage done by a Sneak Attack by allocating points to this skill. Assume that the damage multiplier is × 1 for all characters, but for every point allocated to the skill by a Specialist, the damage multiplier is increased by one.

If a Specialist has any points in Sneak Attack, then he also gets a +2 bonus to hit above any other bonuses he already has when performing a Sneak Attack.

<!-- 1d8 aka 4.5x6 = 27. 1d4 aka 2.5x6 = 21-->
<!-- 2x6= 12 damage-->

###### Back-Stab probably cut
When attacking an unaware opponent from behind, a thief receives a +4 bonus to hit and doubles any damage dealt.

##### Stealth\*
- Hide in shadows (HS): Requires the thief to be motionless—attacking or moving while hiding is not possible.
- Move silently (MS): A thief may attempt to sneak past enemies unnoticed.
- The referee should roll for hear noise, hide in shadows, and move silently on the player’s behalf, as the thief does not immediately know if the attempt was successful. If a hide in shadows or move silently roll fails, the referee knows that the thief has been noticed and should determine enemies’ actions appropriately.

##### Tinker
- Find or remove treasure traps (TR): A roll is required to find a treasure trap and then another to remove it. This may be attempted only once per trap.
- Open locks (OL): Requires thieves’ tools (see Equipment, p40). A thief can only try this skill once per lock. If the roll fails, the thief may not try the same lock again before gaining an experience level.
