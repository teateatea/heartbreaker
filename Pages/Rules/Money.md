*Nations all over the world regularly mint new coins, and currencies are constantly being created, evaluated, converted, or abandoned.*

For the sake of gameplay, money is standardized enough to ignore the minutiae.

- Copper Pennies (CP) are used mostly by the lower class, or in villages.
- Silver Pieces (SP) are used by upper class urbanites. 
- Gold Pieces (GP) are used mainly by royalty.

**This game will use the Silver Standard.** 

Most costs will be listed in Silver or Copper (which can be very loosely approximated to $20 and )

| Gold  | Silver | Copper |
|:----- |:------ |:------ |
| **1** | 10     | 50     |

###### Converting SP to other coins

Platinum (PP) and Electrum (EP) are reference coins, and are not in circulation. They might exist ceremonially, but they are mainly used by banks, for tracking accounts on paper.

| 1        | 5        | 50   | 500    | 25,000 |
