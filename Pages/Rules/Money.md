*Nations all over the world regularly mint new coins, and currencies are constantly being created, evaluated, converted, or abandoned.*

For the sake of gameplay, money is standardized and we ignore the minutiae.

- Copper Pennies (CP) are used mostly by the lower class, or in villages.
- Silver Pieces (SP) are used by the middle class, or in towns and cities. 
- Gold Pieces (GP) are used mainly by royalty.

**This game uses the Silver Standard.** 

<!--Costs will be listed in Silver or Copper, which can be very loosely approximated to 1 SP =$15 to $25, and 1 CP = $3-8.-->

| Gold  | Silver | Copper |

##### Banking
Platinum (PP) and Electrum (EP) are *moneys-of-account*, and are not in circulation. They might exist ceremonially, but are mainly used by banks, for record-keeping and ledgers only.

| Platinum | Electrum | Gold | Silver | Copper |
|:-------- |:-------- |:---- |:------ |:------ |
| 1        | 5        | 50   | 500    | 25,000 |

##### **Converting Silver to Other Coins**
