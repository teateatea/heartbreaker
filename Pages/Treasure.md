These coins standardized enough to ignore the minutiae for gameplay.

*In reality, currencies are constantly being created, evaluated, discontinued, accepted, and converted by people all over the world.*

- Copper Pennies (CP) are used mostly by the lower class, or in villages.
- Silver Pieces (SP) are used by upper class urbanites. 
- Gold Pieces (GP) are used mainly by royalty.

|   Gold   | Silver | Copper |
|:--------:|:------:|:------:|
| **1** | 10  | 50  |

##### Converting SP to other coins:
|   Gold    |         Silver         |   Copper   |
|:---------:|:----------------------:|:----------:|
| $\div 10$ | **(** $\times 1$ **)** | $\times 5$ |

##### Banking
Platinum (PP) and Electrum (EP) are reference coins, and are not in circulation. They might exist ceremonially, but they are mainly used by banks, for tracking accounts on paper.

| Platinum | Electrum | Gold | Silver | Copper |
|:--------:|:--------:|:----:|:------:|:------:|
|    1    |    5    |  50  |  500  | 25,000 |

##### Convert Silver Pieces (SP) to other coins:
| Platinum  | Electrum  |          Gold          |   Silver    |   Copper    |
|:---------:|:---------:|:----------------------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|
| $\div 500$ | $\div 100$ | $\div 10$ | **(** $\times 1$ **)** | $\times 50$ |

***Examples***

*100 SP* $\div 10$ = *10 GP*
