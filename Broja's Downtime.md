# Fire-Proof Armour
*A quote comes back from Phandalin.*

> Mr. Broja,
> 
> We are most encouraged by a request by a man of your stature, and have described several fitting options below. I sincerely believe that you will be most pleased with the possibilities we can bestow upon you.
> 
> If you require immediate protection, please choose a Ring as they do not require bespoke assembly.
> 
> Yours,
> [[Modestia of the House Revere]]

### **Cold Iron Plate Armour** (AC 16, 6 slots)
##### **Cost:** 20,000 GP & 6-8 weeks

Grants the wearer protection against fire.

**Iron Sclerite:** Once per day, as an action, you may activate your armour. For ***R*** turns, fire damage you take is reduced to 0.
- **Elemental Batteries:** This armour is powered by Elemental cores. There are 6 slots in the back of the armour.
    - ***R*** is equal to the HD of the Elemental whose core has been connected to the suit.
    - Elemental cores work best if their source is cooling (*e.g. Water, Ice, Alcohol) *
    - Some secondary Elements may work suboptimally *(e.g. Ooze, Ink, Air),* and can be expected to provide ***R*** equal to half their HD.
    - 1 Water Imp Core is included in the price: ***R*** = +1.
