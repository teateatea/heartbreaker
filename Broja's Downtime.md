# Fire-Proof Armour
*A quote comes back from Phandalin.*

> Mr. Broja,
> 
> We are most encouraged by a request by a man of your stature, and have described several fitting options below. I sincerely believe that you will be most pleased with the possibilities we can bestow upon you.
> 
> If you require immediate protection, please choose a Ring as they do not require bespoke assembly.
> 
> Yours,
> [[Modestia of the House Revere]]

___
### **Ring of Fire Resistance**
##### **Cost:** 2,000 GP
Grants the wearer protection against fire.
- **Normal fire:** Unharmed by non-magical fire.
- **Save bonus:** Gain a +2 bonus to all saving throws versus fire-based magical or breath attacks.
- **Fire-based damage:** Is reduced by 1 point per damage die rolled. (Each die inflicts a minimum of 1 hit point damage.)
___
### **Ring of Superior Fire Resistance**
##### **Cost:** 10,000 GP

- **Normal fire:** Unharmed by non-magical fire.
- **Save bonus:** Gain advantage to all saving throws versus fire-based magical or breath attacks.
- **Fire-based damage:** Is halved. (Each die inflicts a minimum of 1 hit point damage.)
___
### **Cold Iron Plate Armour** (AC 16, 6 slots)
##### **Cost:** 20,000 GP & 6-8 weeks

Grants the wearer protection against fire.
- **Normal fire:** Unharmed by non-magical fire.
- **Fire Resistance:** Gain advantage to all saving throws versus fire-based magical or breath attacks.
- **Fire-based damage:** Is halved. (Each die inflicts a minimum of 1 hit point damage.)
- **Cold Iron Helmet:** Gain advantage to all saving throws versus [[Enchantment Magic|Enchantments and Charms]] of [[Fae]] origin.

**Iron Sclerite:** Once per day, as an action, you may activate your armour. For $R$ turns, fire damage you take is reduced to 0.
- **Elemental Batteries:** This armour is powered by Elemental cores. There are 6 slots in the back of the armour, one of which is already filled.
	- 1 Water Imp Core is included in the price: $R$ = +1.
	- The Resistance gained ($R$) is equal to the HD of the cooling Elemental whose core has been connected to the suit.
	- Elemental cores work best if their source is cooling (*e.g. Water, Ice, Alcohol).* Some secondary Elements may work suboptimally *(e.g. Ooze, Ink, Air),* and can be expected to provide $R$ equal to half their HD.

### Cold Iron Plate Armour - Considerations
#### Heroic Armour (passive)
##### Cost: 5,000 GP, +10 days
Projects a nearly-invisible protective bubble over the wearers head. No need for a helmet, show off that pretty face!

#### Guilded Armour
##### Cost: 1,000 GP, +2 days
Any style of decoration you desire!

#### Hermetic Seal (with activation)
##### Cost: 1,000 GP, +1 day
Necessary if you intend to be submerged in lava, as opposed to only walking through fire.

#### Breathing Spell (with activation) 
##### Cost: 1,000 GP, +1 day
Necessary if you intend to spend time in any space without air for longer than you can hold your breath (e.g. raging infernos, lakes of lava).
- Uses 1 Core Slot, lasting $B$ turns.

#### Additional Elemental Batteries
- **Water Imp Cores:** +1 Resistance (500 GP).
- **Water Elemental Cores:** +4 Resistance (2,000 GP).
- **Air Imp Core:** +1 Breathing (500 GP).
- **Air Elemental Core:** +4 Breathing (2,000 GP).
