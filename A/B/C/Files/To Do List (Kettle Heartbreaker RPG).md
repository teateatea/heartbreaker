- Redo Ability Score tables Page 
	- Single table for Modifiers

##### Not Soon
- Warlock class
- At least one Danarak Discipline
- On the Backgrounds PDF, Vice and Virtue are backwards.
- On Character Appearance box, switch Misfortune and Backgrounds (so that it'll read things like 'Disowned Fortuneteller' instead of Fortuneteller Disowned lol.)
	- Change this on the Backgrounds PDF too.
