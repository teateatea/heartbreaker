[[home|Home]] | **Rand's Retreat**
___
Here are some things you can find at the base right now.

## The Barracks
**Martel** 
Several hostel-style rooms with bunks and lockers.

## *The Crimson Coin* 
**Tavern**
There aren't a lot of options, so everybody spends a lot of time here.

## A well
Near the Crimson Coin, fairly inland.

## The Armoury
**Martel** 
This is where they keep all the stuff. It's also the general store for adventurers, buying or selling weapons, treasure, and other goods.

## The Study
**Martel** 
The one nice building, or at least the only one made of stone. A large room with counters and desks, a private Martel office, a classroom, and a lab.

## The Barn
This is where a decent amount of combat training happens. There aren't any animals yet.

## A field
A lot of physical training happens here too.

## The Carpenter
This is basically a smaller barn kitted out with a workshop to process tropical lumber for buildings and repairing ships.

In a pinch, the Carpenter is also the Surgeon.

### The Port
**Martel** - *Needs a name.*

There's a building here, space for a decent number of ships. The Martels are really big on ships.

Literally everything is imported, except the lumber. There is no farm. The Study was built using imported stone.

### The *Noche Cielo*
**Martel**

A huge ship that's near-permanently moored to the Port. The Martels mostly stay on this ship, it's the head office for the big guns.
