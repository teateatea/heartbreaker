[[home|Home]] | **Rand's Retreat**
___
Here are some things you can find at the base right now.

# A beach
Pretty scenic: black sand, tropical blue seas, brilliant clouds whipping by under a vast cerulean sky. On the horizon to the north-west, you can see a distant island with two volcanic peaks.

# The jungle
The jungle presses in on all sides of your home, sneaking in everytime you turn around. Plants shoot up around every building, every path, anywhere they aren't being constantly stamped down by feet.

There is nature is all around you: birds, spiders, insects, mice, rats, centipedes, the occasional monkey. The nature regularly visits you indoors.

# *Rand's Retreat - Martel Port* 
There's an office here, and enough space for a decent number of ships. The Martels are really big on ships.

Literally everything is imported, except lumber and fish.

## The *Noche Cielo* - *Martel Carrack*
A large ship that's near-permanently moored to the Port. The Martels mostly stay here, it's the head office for the big guns.

## *The Crimson Coin - Tavern* 
There aren't a lot of options, so everybody spends a lot of time here.

The trainers live here, usually 8-10 combat instructors, and 3-5 magic teachers. There's also a rat-trainer.

## A well
Near the Crimson Coin. Central, and fairly inland. The water is crisp.

## The Barracks - *Martel*
Several hostel-style rooms with bunks and lockers.

One of the bunks has two bodies bags in it. Around the side, someone's set up cages for about a dozen rats.

## The Armoury - *Martel*
This is where they keep all the loot, until it's loaded onto a ship and exported.

It's also the general store for adventurers, buying or selling weapons, treasure, and other goods.

## The Study - *Martel*
The one nice building, or at least the only one made of (imported) stone.

One large room with counters and desks, a private Martel office, a small classroom, and a lab. Magical instruction usually happens in the large room, or the lab.

## The Barn
This is where most of the specialized combat training happens.

There aren't any animals yet.

## A cleared field
A lot of physical training happens here.

Some gymnastics equipment has been set up: beams, wooden horses, and trapeze bars.

## The Carpenter
This is a smaller barn that's been kitted out with a workshop to process tropical lumber for building construction and ship repair. In a pinch, the Carpenter is also the Surgeon.

In the corner, someone's also set up a very basic forge, a small crucible, and an anvil.
