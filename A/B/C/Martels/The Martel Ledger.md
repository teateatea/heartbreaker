##### Ledger Details
**Starting Date:** The date this Character first began adventuring.

**Title:** The Character's name.

**Available Funds:** The amount of money this Character currently has available to them for spending, usually gained by selling treasure to the Martels.

**Total Money Spent (XP):** The total money spent by this Character, for both debt repayment and downtime spending. This is also equal to that Character's XP ($1 = 1 XP). See **[[2) Gaining XP|Gaining XP]]** for more details.

**Downtime Spending to Date:** The total money spent by this Character on Downtime Activities. See [[Downtime]] for more details.

**Debt Paid to Date:** The total money spent towards repaying this Character's debt to the Martels.

**Status:** There are 4 possible states:
- **OK** - The Character is ahead of their payment schedule.
- **$X OVERDUE** - The Character is behind schedule on their payments.
- **X HR PENALTY** - When a Character is more than 12 months behind schedule, they suffer painfully for X hours, starting every sunrise *(disadvantage on all rolls)*. This increases by 1 hour every month.
- **ACCOUNT CLOSED** - The Character has fully paid off their debts and is now a free agent. See **[[Martel Debt]]** for more details.

**Expected Repayment by Today's Date:** The amount of money to be paid to the Martels by today's date. This is calculated using the formula below:

> **Monthly Payments** $\times$ months since **Starting Date**

**Monthly Payment:** The expected payments each month. This is equal to 1% of the Character's Initial Debt. Following this payment schedule, Characters will be debt-free in as little as 8 years!

**Initial Debt:** The starting debt for this Character, acquired by the Martels.
