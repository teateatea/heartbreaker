___
# Communication & Community
We'll be using **Discord**! If you're reading this, you've probably already been invited.

___
# Joining a Game
Usually, I'll put out an Open Call, a date and time when I'd like to run a game *(e.g. this Sunday from 7pm-10:30pm)*. Please reply to that message so that I know you're in!

### Player Caps & Waiting Lists
I'm limiting the party size to 4 Players for now, but you're encouraged to join the waiting list. If you signed up for a session, but couldn't play because of the player cap, you get priority on the next session.

And if anyone cancels, I'm going to go down the waiting list looking for players to fill the spot!

### Scheduling a Game
Alternatively, Players *(or groups of Players)* can ask me to run a game! We'll work out a time that works us, and you can let me know if you want me to put out an Open Call for other players.

___
# Dinner
I like to spend time with you guys, so the usual plan is potluck dinner before the game. Please post what you're going to bring so we can coordinate dishes!

___
# Pre-Game Hour
##### Character Creation
New players are encouraged to arrive early to create their first Characters, so that we can start the game on time. If this isn't possible on game day, let's schedule a call or meeting on a different day for onboarding, which takes 30-60 minutes *(depending on how much we chat lol)*. In a pinch, you'll get a **[[Premade Characters|Premade Character]]**, and will be dropped in blind.

##### Upkeep Tasks
*Upkeep tasks include things like advancing Characters, managing Hirelings, purchasing new equipment, managing or checking the progress of downtime activities like arcane research, etc.*

Players who want to do upkeep tasks for established characters are encouraged to do this on Discord, but are welcome to join the pre-game hour to do these activities in person. Please let me know ahead of time if you want to do this *(otherwise I might be making dinner lol).*

___
# Sequel Sessions
If the evening is coming to a close, and the party is in the middle of something important, we can plan a sequel session to continue from this point rather than start anew. In order to continue this expedition, *everyone at the table must agree to a date and time within the next 10 days.*

If that session does not happen for any reason, each character must roll on the **[[End of Session|Escaping the Island!]]** table above to determine how *(or if)* they got back to home base.
