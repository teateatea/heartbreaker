### Spiteful Blade (1d8)
**Cost: 11,500 GP**

Melee (1d6), Missile (5'-10' / **11'-20'** / 21'-30').

- **Spiteful Arc (1d8):** When thrown, draw a **$2$-Arc Path** starting from the attacker, then roll to hit each creature in order along that path. The first creature hit receives full damage (1d8), then for each additional hit this turn, step the damage die down once (1d6, then 1d4, then 1d3). The blade stops at the fourth creature hit (who received 1d3 damage), or else lands at the end of the path.
- **$X$-Arc Path:** Draw a path for the blade with $X$ turns, following these two rules for the entirety of this throw:
	- **Consistent Direction:** Each turn must be made to the same side as the first turn.
	- **Irregular Distances:** The blade may travel 15', 20' or 25' before or after turning, but cannot travel the same distance twice in a row.
- **Retribution:** As a reaction on the same round you throw the blade, you may recall the blade. Draw a **$1$-Arc Path** starting from the blade's current location, then roll to hit each creature as if this were a continuation of **Spiteful Arc.**
- **Catch!** If the blade would come within 5' feet of you, it instead returns to your hands.
