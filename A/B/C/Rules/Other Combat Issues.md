### Attacking from Behind
AC bonuses from shields are negated.

### Blindness
A blind character is unable to attack.

### Bombing
Flying creatures may pick up rocks or other objects and drop them from above.

**Altitude:** At most 300’.

**Chance to hit:** 16 or higher on 1d20.

**Affected area and damage:** Depend on the size of the bomb—larger creatures can carry larger bombs. For example, a bomb from a flying creature able to carry a human might inflict 2d6 damage to all creatures hit in a 10’ × 10’ area.

### Invulnerabilities
Some monsters can only be harmed by magical or silver weapons. The referee may allow such monsters to also be harmed by attacks from:

- Another invulnerable monster.
- A monster with 5 HD or greater.

### Paralysed Opponents
Helpless opponents, such as those magically paralysed or frozen, can be automatically hit in melee. Only a roll for damage is required.

### Spacing
The referee should judge how many attackers can strike at a single opponent, bearing in mind the size of the opponent and the available space around it.

**10’ passage:** Normally at most 2–3 characters can fight side-by-side in a 10’ wide passageway.

### Subduing
Characters that wish to subdue an intelligent opponent must announce that they are attacking without the intent to kill.

**Blunt blows:** Only bludgeoning attacks may be made. Bladed melee weapons may be employed to deal blunt blows with the flat of the blade.

**Subdual damage:** Combat and damage are calculated normally, but subdual damage is noted separately from actual damage.

**Effect at 0hp:** An intelligent character or monster reduced to 0 hit points due to subdual damage fails morale, realising that its opponent could have killed it.

*See **[[Morale]]** for more details.*

### Unarmed Attacks
**Attack rolls:** Unarmed combat is handled the same as melee combat.

**Damage:** Unarmed attacks inflict 1d2 damage, modified by STR.

### Unstable Surfaces
Characters on an unstable surface, such as a ship in stormy seas or riding a flying animal, are affected as follows:

- **Missile attacks:** Suffer a –4 penalty.
- **Spells:** Cannot be cast.
- **Magic items:** Can be used normally.

Note that magical means of flight (e.g. a magic broom, carpet, or the fly spell) generally do not count as unstable.

### Water
When fighting in or beneath water:

- **Penalties:** Attack and damage rolls should be penalised.
- **Missile weapons:** Usually do not work at all underwater.
