[[home|Home]] | [[Open Table Logistics]] | **Escaping the Island!**
___
The expectation is for the Player Characters to begin, and end, each session at home base. In general, the players should make their way to the coast, signal for a pick up and end the session normally.

##### Escaping the Island!
If characters are still on the island when the session ends, they each must roll on the **Escaping the Island!** table to determine how *(or if)* they got home.

| Escaping the Island!                            | 1d100     |
|:----------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| You don't know where you are.                   | DC 75     |
| You know where you are.                         | DC 50     |
| You have a clear and unhindered path of escape. | DC 25     |
| You are in a coastal hex                        | +10 bonus |

On a failure, roll on the **Failed Escapes** table.  

| 1d10 | Failed Escapes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ---- |:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | You escape unharmed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 2    | You escape but have been permanently altered *(maimed, permanently polymorphed, replaced with a double, etc)*.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 3    | You escape but have been injured. You suffer 1d6 $\times$ 1d6 points of damage. If this kills you, see result 10 below.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 4    | You escape, but lost 1d6 random items.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 5    | You escape, but barely. You have 1 hp, and lost 50% of your items. Roll on the **Escape** table again to see if you know where your stuff is.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 6    | You got completely lost. This character is unavailable for 1d20 $\times$ 1d20 days. At the end of that period, they roll 1d6 on this table before returning home.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 7    | You have been captured, petrified, or otherwise trapped. Roll the escape percentile again to see if your comrades know where you are. If they do not, roll the escape percentile again to see if your comrades have a clue of some sort.                                                                   |
| 8    | You have been transformed into a monster *(undead, lycanthrope, mind controlled, etc)*, and will not be picked up by the ship.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 9    | Opportunity for betrayal. You can choose to either reroll on this table or betray a comrade who would otherwise escape. If you choose to betray a comrade roll 1d6 -- on a roll of 1-4, you escape and they must roll on this table; on a roll of 5-6, both you and your victim suffer the fate they roll. |
| 10   | You have died. Roll on the **Escape** table again to see if your comrades were able to retrieve your body. If they did not, roll on the **Escape** table again to see if your comrades know where your body is. If they do not, there is a 50% chance that your body has been utterly destroyed.               |
