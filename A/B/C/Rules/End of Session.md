[[home|Home]] | [[Open Table]] | **Escaping the Island!**
___
The goal is for the Player Characters to begin, and end, each session at home base. At the end of a session, the PCs should make their way to the coast, and signal for a Martel pick up.

##### Escaping the Island!
If PCs are still on the island when the Session ends, they each must roll on the **Escaping the Island!** table to determine how *(or if)* they got home.

| Escaping the Island!                            | 1d100     |
|:----------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| You don't know where you are.                   | DC 75     |
| You know where you are.                         | DC 50     |
| You have a clear and unhindered path of escape. | DC 25     |
| You are in a coastal hex                        | +10 bonus |

On a success, you escape the island unharmed. On a failure, roll on the **Failed Escapes** table.

| 1d10 | Failed Escapes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ---- |:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | You escape unharmed, taking an unusual way home.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 2    | You escape, but have been permanently altered *(maimed, permanently polymorphed, replaced with a double, etc)*.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 3    | You escape, but have been injured. You suffer 1d6 $\times$ 1d6 points of damage. If this kills you, see result 10 below.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 4    | You escape, but lose 1d6 random items.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 5    | You escape, but barely. You have 1 hp, and lost 50% of your items. Roll **Escaping the Island!** again to see if you know where your stuff is.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 6    | You got completely lost. This character is unavailable for 1d20 $\times$ 1d20 days. At the end of that period, they roll 1d6 on **Failed Escapes** before returning home.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 7    | You have been captured, petrified, or otherwise trapped. Roll **Escaping the Island!** again to see if your comrades know exactly where you are. If they do not, roll **Escaping the Island!** again to see if your comrades have a clue of some sort.                                                                   |
| 8    | You have been transformed into a monster *(undead, lycanthrope, mind controlled, etc)*, and will not be picked up by the ship.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 9    | Opportunity for betrayal. You can choose to roll on this table again, or betray a comrade who would otherwise escape. If you choose to betray a comrade, roll 1d6: On a 1-4, you escape unharmed and they must roll a **Failed Escape**; On a 5 or 6, both you and your victim suffer the fate they roll. |
| 10   | You died. Roll **Escaping the Island!** again to see if your party was able to retrieve your body. If they not, roll **Escaping the Island!** again to see if your party knows where your body is. If they do not, there is a 50% chance that your body has been utterly destroyed.               |
