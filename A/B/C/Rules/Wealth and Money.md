### Starting Money
PCs begin play with 3d6 × 10 silver pieces.

PCs beginning on Hot Springs Island start with a [[Martel Debt]] instead.

___
### Money
<!-- The most common coin is the silver piece (sp). Coins made of other metals—platinum (pp), electrum (ep), gold (gp), and copper (cp)—are also used. The conversion rates of coins are shown below. #Revisit Successful characters accumulate wealth from the spoils of their adventures. Treasure may take many forms, but often the most useful form of treasure is money.-->

*Nations all over the world regularly mint new coins, and currencies are constantly being created, evaluated, converted, or abandoned.*

For the sake of gameplay, money is standardized and we ignore the minutiae.

- Copper Pennies (CP) are used mostly by the lower class, or in villages.
- Silver Pieces (SP) are used by the middle class, or in towns and cities. 
- Gold Pieces (GP) are used mainly by royalty.

**This game uses the Silver Standard.** 

<!--Costs will be listed in Silver or Copper, which can be very loosely approximated to 1 SP =$15 to $25, and 1 CP = $3-8.-->

| Gold  |     | Silver |     | Copper |
|:----- | :--- |:------ | :--- |:------ |
| **1 GP** | =   | **10 SP**     | =   | **50 CP**     |


___
### Banking
Platinum (PP) and Electrum (EP) are *moneys-of-account*, and are not in circulation. They might exist ceremonially, but are mainly used by banks, for record-keeping and ledgers only.

| Platinum |     | Electrum |     | Gold |     | Silver |     | Copper |
|:-------- | --- |:-------- | --- |:---- | --- |:------ | --- |:------ |
| 1        | =   | 5        | =   | 50   | =   | 500    | =   | 25,000 |

### **Converting Silver to Other Coins**

| Platinum      | Electrum      | Gold        | Silver | Copper       |
|:------------- |:------------- |:----------- |:------ |:------------ |
| SP $\div$ 500 | SP $\div$ 100 | SP $\div$ 10 | **( SP )** | SP $\times$ 5 |
