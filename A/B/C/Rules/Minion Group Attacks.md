[[Minions]] | [[Minion Group Saves|Minion Group Saves]] | **Minion Group Attacks** | [[Overkill Attacks]]
___
Each minion has a group attack action that speeds up play. In a group attack, two to five minions of the same stat block that share a turn can all use their action to take the same action and attack one target, provided the target is within the attack’s reach or range for each minion.
- Make a single attack roll for the group attack. It counts as one attack.
- A group attack roll gains a +1 bonus to the attack roll for every minion in the attack. (For example, if four goblin minions make a group attack together, the attack roll gains a +4 bonus.)
- If the group attack hits, multiply the damage by the number of minions that made the group attack. (For example, if four goblin minions hit with a group attack that deals 1 damage, their group attack deals 4 damage.)

The GM decides how many minions participate in a group attack. For instance, if five minions surround a target, the GM may decide to have all five attack at once to speed up combat, or may break up the attacks among smaller groups in order to increase the odds that some minions hit while others miss. A single minion can even use their group attack action on their own—they make the attack as a normal creature would, and simply don’t benefit from any group bonuses.

##### Advantage and Disadvantage
A group attack is only made with advantage or disadvantage if all the minions making the group attack have advantage or disadvantage on the attack roll. Otherwise, the attack is made without advantage or disadvantage.

##### Target Response Effects
If a group attack triggers a reaction or similar effect that would normally affect a single attacker, such as the fire shield or hellish rebuke spell, the target of the group attack picks one minion that was part of the attack to be affected by the effect.

##### Group Opportunity Attacks
If a creature provokes an opportunity attack from more than one minion of the same stat block at a time and those minions have a melee group attack action, the minions can each use their reaction to make a group attack as an opportunity attack.
