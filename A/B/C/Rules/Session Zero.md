[[home|Home]] | [[Open Table]] | **Session Zero**
___
## Lines
Lines are hard boundaries that cannot be crossed for any reason. As far as this game is concerned, these basically don't happen anywhere in the world.

These topics have been emphasized to me by players. We won't have all players present at once with an open table, but I'm going to always prepare the game with these in mind *(rather than trying to track which players and lines are relevant for any individual session)*.

##### **[[No animal abuse|No animal abuse.]]**
**Puppies have plot armour.** More specifically, cute non-sentient creatures cannot be harmed in any way.

##### [[No gratuitous gore descriptions|No gratuitous gore descriptions.]]
**Stay classy.** One sentence is fine, six sentences using a thesaurus is not.

### I'm excluding these things always
These themes won't exist in games I prepare:

***Graphic Gore, Harm to Animals, Harm to Children, Homophobia, Miscarriage/Abortion, Rape, Suicide, Transphobia.***

___
## Veils
Veils are soft boundaries that can be included in the game, but will only be discussed as "off-screen" events, or a fade-to-black if they include the Player Characters.

##### **[[Consentual Sex]]**
**Music plays, someone giggles, fade to black.** It's not really the point of this game but if it makes sense narratively, we'll just say everyone had a great time lol.

##### [[Torture]]
**Every hour, roll for damage, victims roll morale. Information quality falls dramatically with time.** No need to get specific, we can just all agree the toturer is an evil person. This can easily escalate past **[[No gratuitous gore descriptions]]** above.

### This Game May Contain The Following Sensitive Topics
- **Substances: *Alcohol, Drugs***
- **Bugs: *Insects, Bugs on/in people, Spiders***
- **Injury: *Hand injuries, Eye Injuries, Teeth Injuries, Starvation***
- **Death: *Death, Death of Parental Figures, Genocide, Pandemics, Natural Disasters***
- **Hate: *Body Shaming, Bullying, Classism, Prejudice, Racism, Sexual Assault, Slavery, Terrorism, Torture, Violence***

*Please* talk with me if you any questions or concerns!
