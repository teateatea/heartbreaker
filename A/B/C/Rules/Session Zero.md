## Content Warnings
### The Following Sensitive Topics May Appear On-Screen
I allow these themes to appear in games I run, so Player Characters should expect to witness, or experience, some number of them over the course of a campaign. 

- **Substances: *Alcohol, Drugs***
- **Sex: *Nudity, Provocative Imagery***
- **Bugs: *Insects, Bugs on/in people, Spiders***
- **Injury: *Eye Injuries, Hand injuries, Teeth Injuries, Starvation***
- **Death: *Death, Death of Parental Figures, Natural Disasters***
- **Hate: *Body Shaming, Bullying, Classism, Prejudice, Racism, Sexual Harassment, Slavery, Terrorism, Violence***

I'm explicitly calling these out, because if you're uncomfortable with any of these, then I *want* you to let me know. We can talk about how they may appear, and I'm happy to limit or eliminate topics that you're not comfortable with. We can even talk about playing a completely different game if you're really not on board.

**Please feel free to bring up all questions and concerns!**

## Lines
Lines are hard boundaries that cannot be crossed for any reason. As far as this game is concerned, these basically don't happen anywhere in the world.

The following topics have been emphasized to me by players. We won't have all players present at once with an open table, but I'm going to always prepare the game with these Lines in mind *(rather than trying to track which Players and Lines are relevant for any given session)*.

##### **[[No animal abuse|No animal abuse.]]**
**Puppies have plot armour.** More specifically, cute non-sentient creatures cannot be harmed in any way.

##### [[No gratuitous gore descriptions|No gratuitous gore descriptions.]]
**Stay classy.** One sentence is fine, six sentences using a thesaurus is not.

### I'm excluding these things always
I don't allow these themes to exist in any games I prepare:

***Graphic Gore, Harm to Animals, Harm to Children, Homophobia, Transphobia, Miscarriage/Abortion, Rape, Sexual Assault, Suicide.***

___
## Veils
Veils are soft boundaries that can be included in the game, but will generally be discussed as "off-screen" events, or a fade-to-black if they include the Player Characters.

##### **[[Consentual Sex]]**
**Music plays, someone giggles, fade to black.** It's not really the point of this game but if it makes sense narratively, we'll just say everyone had a great time lol.

##### [[Torture]]
**Every hour, the torture rolls damage, and the victim rolls morale. Information quality falls dramatically with time.** No need to get specific, we can just all agree the toturer is an evil person. This can easily escalate to **[[No gratuitous gore descriptions]]** above, so let's stick to the two rolls.

### The Following Sensitive Topics May Be Veiled
I allow these themes to be described, but they won't be the focus of the game.

***Consentual Sex, Pregnancy, Pandemics, Torture.***

**Again, *please* talk with me if you any questions or concerns!**
