___
For the purpose of these rules:
- **Creature:** Any Player Character (PC), Non-Player Character (NPC), Monster, group of Monsters, or other agent of change that is participating in the combat.
- **Active Creature:** The Creature that is currently taking an Action, who is taking their turn.

___
### **Combat Sequence Per Round**
1. Roll Initiative
2. Take Action
3. Pass the Action
4. End of Round

___
### 1. Roll Initiative
**Roll 1d20+MOD:** At the start of each combat, each Creature rolls Initiative, modified by DEX or WIS *(see **[[Ability Scores]]**)*. <!--The referee may determine an initiative modifier for Monsters that are very fast or slow, instead of applying a DEX modifier.-->

**Winner:** The individual with the highest result acts first.

**Ties:** Players win ties, or both sides may roll again to determine a winner.

___
### 2. Take Action
The Active Creature performs their action, such as attacking, casting spells, and/or moving.

*See **[[Combat Actions]]** for more details about the combat turn.*



___
### 3. Pass the Action
After completing their action, the Active Creature nominates the next Creature to take their turn. That Creature takes their Action, and then nominates who goes next.

Once every Creature has acted this Round, the last Creature will decide who acts first in the next round (and can choose themselves).


##### Jumping In
Any Creature that has been affected by the Active Creature may choose to jump in. This occurs most commonly when a Creature has been attacked, and wants to immediately retaliate.

The affected Creature takes their action (as if they had been nominated), and then nominates who goes next.

If multiple Creatures want to Jump In, they may roll Initiative to determine which one acts.

> This rule may appear to make coordinated attacks and ambushes impossible, but Creatures may **[[Combat Actions#Readying an Action|Ready an Action]]** if simultaneous action is required.
> 
> For example, multiple Creatures can prepare to strike "as soon as Liliana shoots her arrow," resulting in six arrows being loosed before Liliana needs to nominate the next Creature.


___
### 4. End of Round
The End of Round phase occurs, after the last Creature has acted, but before the next Round begins. Monsters must make a Morale Check, and combat effects may end (see below for details). Then the next Round will begin, and any Creature can be nominated to act.

##### Monster Morale
*See **[[Morale]]**.*

##### Effect Durations
All effects *(such as physical conditions, magical effects, or poisons)* reduce their Duration by 1. Any effect already at Duration 0 expires.

> For example, Alice casts a Spell that lasts 1 Round on Bob. Alice is the last person to go that Round, so the End of Round phase occurs, and her Spell's Duration is reduced to 0. It continues through the entire next Round, expiring at the end of *that* round.

> An easy way to track effects with Duration is with a d10. When Alice casts a spell that lasts 1 Round, set a d10 to “1.” At the End of Round, count down the effect. When the die is set to "0," do not remove it. Instead, remove the die when it is already on 0 when a Round ends.
