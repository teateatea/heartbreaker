___
### Combat Sequence Per Round
1. Declare spells and retreats
2. Initiative: Each side rolls 1d6.
3. Winning side acts:
	1. Monster morale
	2. Movement
	3. Missile attacks
	4. Spell casting
	5. Melee attacks
4. Other sides act: In initiative order.

## Declare Spells and Retreats
Characters who wish to cast a spell or move when in melee must declare this. Other actions need not be declared.

## Initiative <!-- #Revisit -->
**Roll 1d6:** For each side at the start of each round.

**Winner:** The side with the highest roll acts first. Other sides act in order from highest to lowest roll.

**Ties:** Either both sides may roll again or actions on both sides may be resolved simultaneously. (This means that both sides may inflict deadly blows on each other!)

### Slow Weapons
Characters attacking with two-handed melee weapons (and some missile weapons—as indicated in the equipment description) always act last in the round, as if they had lost initiative.

### Individual Initiative (Optional Rule)
Instead of an initiative roll per side, a roll may be made for each individual involved in a battle, modified by DEX (see [[Ability Scores]]). The referee may determine an initiative modifier for monsters that are very fast or slow, instead of applying a DEX modifier.

___
## Monster Morale
*See **[[Morale]]**.*

___
## Movement
### Outside of Melee
**Movement rate:** A character can move up to their encounter movement rate each round.

**Maximum duration:** Characters may move at this rate for at most 60 rounds.

### In Melee
When in melee with a foe, only the following forms of movement are possible:

* **Fighting withdrawal:** The character moves backwards at up to half their encounter movement rate. There must be a clear path for this movement.
* **Retreat:** The character turns and flees from melee, moving up to their full encounter movement rate. This round: the character may not attack; the opponent gains a +2 bonus to all attacks against the character and ignores any AC bonus due to the character’s shield (if applicable).

___
## Missile Attacks
Are possible when opponents are more than 5’ from one another. See **''Attacking**''.

### Range Modifiers
All missile weapons have ranges, noted in the equipment lists. <!-- #Revisit -->

**Short range:** +1 bonus to attack rolls.

**Medium range:** No bonuses or penalties.

**Long range:** –1 penalty to attack rolls.

**Beyond long range:** Attack not possible.

### Targets Behind Cover
**Complete cover:** The target cannot be hit.

**Partial cover:** The referee may apply attack penalties of between –1 and –4 (e.g. a small table might incur a –1 penalty; dense woods might incur a –4 penalty).

___
## Spell Casting
**Freedom:** The character must be able to speak and move their hands. A spell caster cannot cast spells if gagged, bound, or in an area of magical silence.

**Sole action:** When casting a spell, no other actions may be taken in the round.

**No movement:** The character cannot move and cast a spell in the same round.

**Line of sight:** Unless noted in a spell’s description, the intended target (a specific monster, character, object, or area of effect) must be visible to the caster.

### Disrupting Spells
If a spell caster loses initiative and is successfully attacked or fails a saving throw before their turn, the spell being cast is disrupted and fails. It is removed from the caster’s memory as if it had been cast.

___
## Melee Attacks
Are possible when opponents are 5’ or less from each other. See **''Attacking**''.

___
## Other Sides Act
Repeat steps 3a to 3e for each side, in order of initiative (highest first).

___
## Attacking
### Attack Rolls *(AAC)*
1. **Roll 1d20**
2. **Apply modifiers:** STR for melee; DEX, range, cover for missile attacks.
3. **Determine hit AC:** Add the character’s attack bonus to the attack roll. The result is the ascending AC score that the attack hits.
4. **Result:** If the hit AAC is equal to or higher than the opponent’s AAC, the attack hits. Roll for damage.

### 1s and 20s
Unmodified attack rolls of 20 always hit. Unmodified attack rolls of 1 always miss.

### Invulnerabilities
Some monsters are immune to certain attacks. In this case, even if an attack hits, damage is not rolled.

### Attacks Per Round
PCs normally attack once per round. Some monsters have multiple attacks.

### Attacking and Moving
Movement and attacking may be combined in the same round.

### Rolling for Damage *(Variable Weapon Damage)*
**PC attacks:** Inflict the damage indicated for the weapon in the equipment lists. Damage of melee attacks is modified by STR.

**Monster attacks:** Deal the damage indicated in the monster’s description.

**Minimum damage:** An attack which hits always deals at least one point of damage, even when damage modifiers reduce the number rolled to 0 or less.

**Death:** A monster reduced to 0 hit points or less is killed. For PCs reduced to 0 hit points, see **[[Healing & Death|Death]]**.
