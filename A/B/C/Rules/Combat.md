[[home|Home]] | [[Rules]] | Adventures | **Combat**
___
For the purpose of these rules:
- **Creature:** Any Player Character (PC), Non-Player Character (NPC), Monster, group of Monsters, or other agent of change that is participating in the combat.
- **Active Creature:** The Creature that is currently taking an Action, who is taking their turn.

___
### **Combat Order - Popcorn Initiative**
1. Roll Initiative
2. Take Action
3. Pass the Action
4. End of Round

___
### 1. Roll Initiative
**Roll 1d20+MOD:** At the start of each combat, each Creature rolls Initiative, modified by DEX or WIS *(see **[[Ability Scores]]**)*. <!--The referee may determine an initiative modifier for Monsters that are very fast or slow, instead of applying a DEX modifier.-->

**Winner:** The individual with the highest result acts first.

**Ties:** Players win ties, or both sides may roll again to determine a winner.

___
### 2. Take Action
The Active Creature performs their action, such as attacking, or casting spells, and may move if they wish.

*See **[[Combat Actions]]** for more details about the combat turn.*

___
### 3. Pass the Action
After completing their action, the Active Creature nominates the next Creature to take their turn. That Creature takes their Action, and then nominates who goes next.

Once every Creature has taken their Action, the last Creature will decide who acts first in the next round (and can choose themselves).

___
### 4. End of Round
The End of Round phase occurs, after the last Creature has acted, but before the next Round begins. Monsters must make a Morale Check, and combat effects may end (see below for details). Then the next Round will begin, and any Creature can be nominated to act.

##### Monster Morale
*See **[[Morale]]**.*

##### Effect Durations
All effects *(such as physical conditions, magical effects, or poisons)* reduce their Duration by 1. Any effect already at Duration 0 expires.

> Alice casts a spell that lasts 1 round on Bob. Alice is the last person to go that Round. After that, the End of Round phase occurs, so the Spell's Duration is reduced to 0. It continues through the entire next Round and expires in the End of Round phase at the end of the *next* round.

> An easy way to track it is to effects with Duration is with a d10. When Alice casts a spell that lasts 1 Round, put a d10 out set on “1.” At the End of Round, count down the effect. However, do not remove the die when it reaches 0. Instead, remove the die when it is already on 0 when a Round ends.
