___
### Tracking Time
When an adventure is under way, the referee should keep track of the time that elapses in the imagined world, known as game time. This is distinct from real time: what may take the players and referee mere seconds to describe may take PCs hours or even days to complete.

For example, when characters are exploring a dungeon, the referee tracks the number of turns that have elapsed; when characters are exploring the wilderness, the number of days elapsed is tracked.

The referee must adjudicate what may be accomplished in a given period of time.

##### Resources
As game time passes, the referee should pay attention to resources that the party consumes. For example: food, water, fuel for light sources, durations of spells or magical effects, etc.

___
### Tracking Movement
As player characters explore the imagined world, the referee should keep track of their location on a prepared map. The map is usually kept secret from the players, who must rely on the referee’s descriptions of the areas they explore.

To determine how long it takes for characters to move from one area to the next, the referee should refer to the characters’ movement rates.

##### Group Movement Rate
An adventuring party will usually want to stay together. The movement rate of the party as a whole is determined by the speed of the slowest member.

___
### Measurements
#### Time: Rounds and Turns
Aside from everyday time increments (minutes, hours, days, and so on), the following special units are used in the game. 

**Turns:** 10 minutes of game time. There are 6 turns in an hour. Time is measured in turns when exploring dungeons (see [[Dungeon Adventuring]]). <!-- #Revisit -->

**Rounds:** 10 seconds of game time. There are 60 rounds in a turn. Time is measured in rounds during encounters, especially in combat (see [[Encounters]] and [[Combat]]). <!-- #Revisit -->

##### Distance: Inches, Feet, Yards, Miles
Staying true to its origins, this game uses imperial or customary US units. Distances are measured in inches (notated with a ”), feet (notated with a ’), yards, and miles.

##### Distance Conversions
1 foot = 12 inches

1 yard = 3 feet

1 mile = 1,760 yards = 5,280 feet

##### Weight: Coins
Weight measures typically come into play only when discussing how much characters can carry (see **Encumbrance**).
As coins are the most common form of treasure found by adventurers, all weights are measured in coins. (Ten coins are equivalent to one pound.)

___
### Encumbrance (Optional Rule)

Some groups may wish to use a system to track the amount of gear and treasure a character can carry and how this affects their movement rate.

##### Tracking Encumbrance

Encumbrance is a measure of both the weight and bulk a character is carrying.

**Treasure:** The encumbrance of treasure carried by a character should be tracked. The encumbrance of common items of treasure is shown in the table below. The referee should decide the weight of other forms of treasure.

**Equipment:** Two options for tracking the encumbrance of characters’ equipment are presented to the right. The same system should be applied to all characters.

**Maximum load:** The maximum load any character can carry is 1,600 coins of weight. Characters carrying more than this cannot move.

##### Option 1: Basic Encumbrance

**Treasure:** The weight of treasure carried is tracked to make sure that the character’s maximum load is not exceeded.

**Equipment:** The weight of armour, weapons, and adventuring gear is not tracked and does not count towards a character’s maximum load.

**Movement rate:** Is determined by the type of armour the character is wearing and whether they are carrying a significant amount of treasure (as judged by the referee). The actual weight of the treasure carried does not affect movement rate.

| style="border:none; padding: 8px;"| 60’ (20’)
| style="border:none; padding: 8px;"| 30’ (10’)

|}


##### Option 2: Detailed Encumbrance

**Treasure:** The weight of coins and other treasure carried is tracked.

**Equipment:** The weight of the character’s armour and weapons is also tracked (the weight of these items is listed in the genre rules book). Miscellaneous adventuring gear (backpack, spikes, sacks, etc.) may be counted as 80 coins of weight.

**Movement rate:** The character’s movement rate is based on the total weight of all significant items carried, including treasure, weapons, and armour.

| style="border:none; padding: 8px;;"| **Encumbrance**
| style="border:none; padding: 8px;;"| **Movement Rate**

|-
| style="border:none; padding: 8px;;"| Up to 400 coins
| style="border:none; padding: 8px;;"| 120’ (40’)

|-
| style="border:none; padding: 8px;;"| Up to 600 coins
| style="border:none; padding: 8px;;"| 90’ (30’)

|-
| style="border:none; padding: 8px;;"| Up to 800 coins
| style="border:none; padding: 8px;;"| 60’ (20’)

|-
| style="border:none; padding: 8px;;"| Up to 1,600 coins
| style="border:none; padding: 8px;;"| 30’ (10’)
