___
All characters and monsters have a hit point total, which represents their ability to avoid death. Many attack forms, including attacks with weapons in combat, subtract hit points from this pool.
___
### Healing
**Natural:** For each full day of complete rest, a character or monster recovers **1d3 hit points.** If the rest is interrupted, the character or monster will not heal that day.

**Magical:** Healing may also occur through magic, such as potions or spells. This kind of healing is instantaneous. Magical healing and natural healing can be combined.

___
### Death
A character or monster reduced to 0 hit points or less is killed.

Player Characters who are reduced to 0 hit points must immediately **save vs Death.**
- On a **success**, they are instead reduced to 1 HP.
- On a **failure**, they mark off one Death Save *(at the top of their Character Sheet)*, and must immediately **save vs Death** again. If they have already marked off three failed Death Saves, they are killed.

___
### Destruction of Items
If a character is killed by a destructive spell or special attack (e.g. a lightning bolt spell or a dragon’s breath), their equipment is assumed to be destroyed.

##### Destruction of Magic Items
Magic items in the possession of a character who is killed by a destructive spell or special attack may be allowed a chance to survive, as follows:
- **Save:** For each item, a saving throw may be made using the character’s saving throw values.
- **Bonuses:** Items that grant a bonus in combat *(e.g. magical weapons and armour)* may also apply this bonus to the saving throw.
