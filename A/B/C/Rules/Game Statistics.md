Player Characters are described, in game terms, by a set of statistics that define their abilities, strengths, and weaknesses in the game world.

### [[Ability Scores]]
The basic physical and mental strengths and weaknesses of the character.

There are 6 ability scores: **Strength** *(abbreviated STR)*, **Intelligence** *(INT)*, **Wisdom** *(WIS)*, **Dexterity** *(DEX)*, **Constitution** *(CON)*, and **Charisma** *(CHA)*. A character is ranked in each ability score by a number between 3–18. *(3 being the worst score possible and 18 the best.)*

*See **[[Ability Scores]]** for more details.*

### Class
An adventuring profession to which the character belongs. A character’s class defines their main abilities. See [[Classes]].

### Race
Unless a demihuman class is selected, the character is assumed to be human.

### Level
The character’s experience as an adventurer is denoted by their experience level. Characters typically start play at 1st level *(the lowest level of adventurer)* and can increase in level through successful adventuring. As a character goes up in level, they gain more powerful abilities, as defined by their class.

### Experience Points (XP)
The character’s advancement in the game is tracked by the accumulation of experience points. Experience points are awarded by the referee after a successful adventure. When the character has accumulated a certain number of experience points, the character’s level increases. Each class specifies the number of experience points required to achieve each experience level.

*See **[[2) Gaining XP|Gaining XP]]** for more details.*

### Hit Points (hp)
The character’s ability to avoid dying. The character has a maximum hit point total and a current hit point total, which are tracked separately. When a character is harmed, their current hit point total is reduced. If this number reaches 0, the character is dead! Rest or healing can restore lost hit points, but never above the character’s maximum hit point total *(this is only increased when the character increases in level).* <!-- #Revisit -->

*See **[[Healing & Death|Death]]**, or **[[Checks, Damage, Saves#Damage and Healing|Damage and Healing]]** for more details.*

### Hit Dice (HD)
The number of dice used to determine the character’s maximum hit point total. The character’s class determines the type of dice rolled (i.e. d4, d6, d8) and the character’s level determines the number of dice rolled. *(Some classes also grant a flat bonus to hit points at certain levels, instead of or in addition to an extra HD.)*

### Armour Class (AC)
The character’s ability to avoid damage in combat. Armour Class is determined by the character’s Dexterity score and by the armour they wear. Higher AC scores are better, so a bonus to AC increases the character’s AC score and a penalty decreases the AC score.

### Attack Bonus (AB)
The character’s ability to hit foes in combat, determined by their class and level. Attack rolls involve rolling a d20, then adding the character's AB.

*See **[[Combat]]** for more details.*<!-- #Revisit -->

### Saving Throw Values
The character’s ability to avoid being affected by certain types of dangerous or detrimental effects. There are five saving throw categories: death *(or poison)*, wands, paralysis *(or petrification)*, breath attacks, spells *(or magic rods or staves)*. The character’s saving throw values are determined by class and level.

*See **[[Checks, Damage, Saves|Saving Throws]]** for full details.*<!-- #Revisit -->

### Movement Rate
The speed at which the character can move when exploring, travelling, or during combat. Every character has a base movement rate and an encounter movement rate *(noted in parentheses).*<!-- #Revisit --> The encounter movement rate is one third of the base movement rate. The default movement rate for characters is 120’ (40’)—a base movement rate of 120’ and an encounter movement rate of 40’.

### Class Abilities
Finally, the character’s class denotes a set of special abilities that the character may use. These include the ability to use certain types of armour and weapons and the ability to speak one or more languages.
