***GM Reminder: Puppies have plot armour.***

Specifically, **cute non-sentient creatures**, like dogs, cats, etc, should not be harmed in any way.
- [[Dogs]]
- [[Cats]]
- Small animals
- The babies of large animals

##### *Non-cute* creatures are allowed to get hurt.
There are plenty of non-cute monsters for the PCs to fight lol.

##### Cute ***but sentient*** creatures are allowed to get hurt.
It's okay to hurt the mousefolk, faerie folk, or other cute adults.

> *"It's okay to kick a kid-sized person-thing."*

### But cute non-sentient creatures are allowed to _not_ get hurt!
- Cute animals can be *not-hurt-but-probably-not-happy*, such as a vampire deciding he wants a pet cat so he kidnaps yours.

> *"This is fine, but we're getting that cat back"*

- **Please explicitly call it out if something becomes cute!** Sometimes really ugly things are inexplicably also cute, but I might not realize those ones.

> *"This is my pet giant leech Slurpee, and he's adorable! He has plot armour now, thanks."*
