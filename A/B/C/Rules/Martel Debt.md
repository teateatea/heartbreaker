___
If you have a Martel Debt, the Martels always confiscate all recovered loot (only returning your mundane equipment). You're welcome to buy them back later, at a premium of course. *(See **[[Loot For Sale]]** for more details.)*

### Free Agents
If you don't have a Martel Debt, you may sell any items you choose. The Martels no longer confiscate all recovered loot.

You are free to leave at any time, but the Martels will never bring you back if you leave. For the purposes of this campaign, when you return to the mainland, you also retire from adventuring and gladly live out the rest of your quiet life.
