[[home|Home]] | **Martel Debt**
___
If you have a Martel Debt, they always take all items from you (returning your mundane stuff). You're welcome to buy them back later, at a premium of course.

If you don't have a martel debt, you may choose to sell any items you'd like.

You are free to leave at any time, but they'll never bring you back here if you leave. For the purposes of this campaign, you return to the mainland, retire from adventuring and gladly live a quiet life.
