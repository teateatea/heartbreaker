Though minions often make saving throws individually, there are times when rolling individual saves for each minion could slow down the action, like when a cleric surrounded by eighteen specter minions uses Turn Undead.

When many minions with the same stat block need to make a saving throw against the same effect at the same time, you can make one saving throw for a group of up to five minions at a time. All minions in a group use the result of the saving throw.

For instance, if thirty-four goblin minions need to make a saving throw against a hypnotic pattern spell, the minions would make a total of seven saving throws against the spell: six for thirty minions divided into six groups of five, and one more save for the remaining group of four minions.
