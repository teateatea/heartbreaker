### Building Minion Encounters
Minions present opportunities for memorable, cinematic encounters. Keep the following tips in mind to achieve maximum fun while planning and running combat encounters with minions.
##### Encounter Difficulty
When building encounters against a single foe, the core rules advise matching the characters with a creature whose CR is close to the average party level. What happens when you add minions to the mix?

Remember that a minion is worth only a fifth of the experience points of normal creatures of that challenge rating. Similarly, when building encounters, five minions count as just one creature for the purpose of calculating encounter difficulty.

Unlike standard creatures, it’s difficult for a group of minions to challenge characters if their challenge rating is at least 2 lower than the average party level. In general, avoid using such minions unless you want to build a trivial combat encounter. You can increase a minion’s challenge rating using the rules in Modifying and Making Minions.

##### Tell Your Players
While it’s tempting to pit your unsuspecting players against a horde of fire giants just to watch their eyes pop out of their faces in surprise, minion encounters are more fun overall if you share the rules for minions with your players before they get into an encounter. They’ll understand how overkill and group attacks work, spend their resources more efficiently, and be able to help you track the fight more easily, which is worth a lot more than the shock value of a sea of foes the players don’t know are minions.
 
If you want the best of both worlds, end a session with the characters confronting a horde of creatures before rolling initiative. At the start of the next session, reveal those creatures are minions and share the rules.

##### Not Too Many
When you’re planning your encounters, think of five minions as one creature. While it might be exciting to throw a hundred minions at the characters, that’s like them facing twenty standard creatures. It can be done and might even be fun, but it’s not the typical minion experience and results in a much longer battle than normal. Keep the following tips in mind when adding minions to an encounter:
- When the characters are 10th level or lower, most encounters work well with ten to twenty minions in addition to other creatures.
- When the characters are 11th level or higher, they’re more efficient at killing minions, and many of the poor critters will die before they even act. Most high-level encounters work well with twenty to thirty minions.
- If you find mid-battle that minions are dying too quickly to present a challenge, you can have reinforcements join the fray.

##### Add Standard Creatures
Minion encounters become more dynamic if you add some standard creatures allied with the minions. A hag coven surrounded by ogre minions or a red dragon tyrant commanding fire giant minions present more interesting encounters than copies of the same enemy, challenging the characters to use diverse tactics.

##### Cut the Choke Points
Since minions are most effective in numbers, avoid encounters in cramped dungeon tunnels and similar choke points. Combat becomes dull in tight quarters if only a couple minions can attack at a time.

### Modifying and Making Minions
You can increase a minion’s challenge rating or create new minions using the Minion Statistics by Challenge Rating table. To change an existing minion’s challenge rating, adjust their proficiency bonus, hit points, and damage dealt by their attacks. If a minion’s proficiency bonus changes, their AC, attack bonuses, and the DC for ability checks and saving throws made to resist the minion’s traits and actions modifier, consider giving the creature natural armor that grants a bonus to AC equal to their proficiency bonus. The table is merely a guide—feel free to tweak the math to get the specific minion you desire.

title: Minion Bands
collapse: open
A combat encounter with more than five minions per character can become deadly if all minions act on the same turn. The characters cut down minion hordes on their turns but then suffer massive damage as a sea of minions pour down on them. While many groups like this challenge, you have the option to divide the minions into different bands that act on different initiative counts. If you do this, minions can only join group attacks with minions in the same band. At the start of a new round, two or more bands of minions can reorganize into one band, acting on the lowest initiative count of the bands that combined.

If you divide minions into bands, be sure to distinguish which minions belong together. For gridded combat, you could use a colored marker for each miniature, or in a theater of the mind encounter, try group descriptors like “zombie dwarves” and “zombie elves.”
