___
## Readying an Action
Any creature may specify an action and a trigger condition. If the trigger condition appears, they may choose to take the readied action, or wait until it is triggered again by something else.

If that creature hasn't taken the readied action by the time they are nominated again, they lose that readied action (but may ready it again if they wish).


___
## Waiting
Any Creatures may choose to wait, instead of immediately taking action. They nominate another Creature to act, and are now considered "waiting". They must wait until they are nominated again to take their action.

If a waiting creature has been nominated, and all remaining creatures are also waiting, they can no longer wait and must act.


___
## Movement
### Outside of Melee
**Movement rate:** A character can move up to their encounter movement rate each round.

**Maximum duration:** Characters may move at this rate for at most 60 rounds.

### In Melee
When in melee with a foe, only the following forms of movement are possible:

* **Fighting withdrawal:** The character moves backwards at up to half their encounter movement rate. There must be a clear path for this movement.
* **Retreat:** The character turns and flees from melee, moving up to their full encounter movement rate. For a Duration of 1 Round, the character may not attack, and their opponents gain a +2 bonus to all attacks against the character and ignores any AC bonus due to the character’s shield (if applicable).

___
## Attacking
### Attack Rolls <!--*(AAC)*-->
1. **Roll 1d20**
2. **Apply modifiers:** STR for melee; DEX, range, cover for missile attacks.
3. **Determine hit AC:** Add the character’s attack bonus to the attack roll. The result is the ascending AC score that the attack hits.
4. **Result:** If the hit AAC is equal to or higher than the opponent’s AAC, the attack hits. Roll for damage.

### 1s and 20s
Unmodified attack rolls of 20 always hit. Unmodified attack rolls of 1 always miss.

### Invulnerabilities
Some monsters are immune to certain attacks. In this case, even if an attack hits, damage is not rolled.

### Attacks Per Round
PCs normally attack once per round. Some monsters have multiple attacks.

### Attacking and Moving
Movement and attacking may be combined in the same round.

### Slow Weapons
Characters with Slow weapons *(as indicated in the equipment description)* may only attack after all non-waiting creatures have taken their turn.

___
### Rolling for Damage <!-- *(Variable Weapon Damage)*-->
**PC attacks:** Inflict the damage indicated for the weapon in the equipment lists. Damage of melee attacks is modified by STR.

**Monster attacks:** Deal the damage indicated in the monster’s description.

**Minimum damage:** An attack which hits always deals at least one point of damage, even when damage modifiers reduce the number rolled to 0 or less.

**Death:** A monster reduced to 0 hit points or less is killed. For PCs reduced to 0 hit points, see **[[Healing & Death|Death]]**.


___
## Melee Attacks
Are possible when opponents are **5’ or less** from each other. See **''Attacking**''.

___
## Missile Attacks
Are possible when opponents are **more than 5’** from one another. See **''Attacking**''.

### Range Modifiers
All missile weapons have ranges, noted in the equipment lists. <!-- #Revisit -->

**Short range:** +1 bonus to attack rolls.

**Medium range:** No bonuses or penalties.

**Long range:** –1 penalty to attack rolls.

**Beyond long range:** Attack not possible.

### Targets Behind Cover
**Complete cover:** The target cannot be hit.

**Partial cover:** The referee may apply attack penalties of between –1 and –4 (e.g. a small table might incur a –1 penalty; dense woods might incur a –4 penalty).


___
## Spell Casting
**Freedom:** The character must be able to speak and move their hands. A spell caster cannot cast spells if gagged, bound, or in an area of magical silence.

**Sole action:** When casting a spell, no other actions may be taken in the round.

**No movement:** The character cannot move and cast a spell in the same round.

**Line of sight:** Unless noted in a spell’s description, the intended target (a specific monster, character, object, or area of effect) must be visible to the caster.

### Disrupting Spells
If a spell caster is successfully attacked or fails a saving throw before their turn ends, the spell being cast is disrupted and fails. It is removed from the caster’s memory as if it had been cast. This is usually as a result of a readied action.
