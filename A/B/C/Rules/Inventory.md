### Quick Access
Items stored in slots at the top of the inventory sheet are marked as Quick Access. These items may be stored in sheaths, on convenient belts or small pockets, and can be retrieved at a moments notice. Weapons or tools to be used during combat should generally be stored here.

### Retrieving Items From Your Bag
If you want to draw items from your bag during combat, roll 1d20: You may retrieve any item whose slot number is equal to or lower than the result, and use it this round. If you do not draw an item out this round, this counts as your action.

Next round, you may roll 1d20 again, adding it to the previous result: You may draw any item whose slot number is equal to or lower than the total, and use it this round. Repeat this process until you retrieve the desired item.
