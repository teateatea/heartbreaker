___

- **Expeditions begin on the real world date.**

> *For example, if we play on June 1st in the real world, then the Party is also starting from June 1st in the game world.*

- **Expedition duration is counted using in-game time.**

> If the Party then spends 5 nights on the island before returning home, then that expedition ends on June 6th.*

- **For each day that passes in the real world, a day also passes in the game world.** 

> The next time we play is on June 21st in the real world. That means the Characters have spent June 6th to 21st, about two weeks, recovering, training, partying, etc.
