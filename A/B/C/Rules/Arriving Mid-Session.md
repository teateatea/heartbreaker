___
Sometimes players arrive late, that's life. When a new character joins an expedition part way through the session, they roll on the **Where did you come from?** table.

| d12 | Where Did You Come From?                                                                                                                  |

| 1   | You were separated from your original group. You have no rations, haven't eaten in d6 days, and you've lost 1d4 random items.                                        |
| 2   | Yesterday, you survived local fauna, but took 1d6 damage.                                                                                 |
| 3   | You got black-bagged in the night. You could hear raucous laughter and joking, and they dumped you nearby before sunrise. -1 random item. |
| 4   | You walked through an archway in the city, and suddenly found yourself halfway across the island.                                         |
| 5   | You fell through something in the city, and got washed through pipes into the ocean.                                                      |
| 6   | Your companions left you for dead when you got swallowed by something. It regurgitated you within the hour though!                        |
| 7   | You tried to hunt something that you couldn't kill. Your companions were either killed or left behind.                                    |
| 8   | You ran into something *scary*. You fled, and here you are.                                                                               |
| 9   | Your companions got into something they shouldn't have. You didn't make that mistake.                                                     |
| 10  | Your expedition spent time in blue hot springs. You feel great but can't remember where they went. +1 inspiration.                        |
| 11  | You woke up this morning alone. No evidence of your missing partners, but you kept the stuff worth keeping. +1 random item.               |
| 12  | You thought you could do an easy solo mission. You're a little in over your head now, but so far so good. +2 random item.                 |
