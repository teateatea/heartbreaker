___
An encounter begins when the characters stumble onto a monster, either because the referee has planned an encounter in the area the PCs are exploring or because a random die roll indicates an encounter (see [[Hazards and Challenges|Wandering Monsters]]).

## Encounter Sequence
1. **Surprise:** The referee rolls for surprise, if applicable.
2. **Encounter distance:** The referee determines how far away the monsters are from the PCs.
3. **Initiative:** Any sides that are not surprised roll initiative to determine who acts first.
4. **Actions:** Any sides that are not surprised decide how they will respond to the encounter. The encounter is played out accordingly.
5. **Conclusion:** One turn has passed.

## Surprise
### When to Check
A check for surprise is made for any side that is not expecting the encounter. For example, if a monster is waiting quietly for an approaching party that is making a lot of noise, the monster would not have a chance to be surprised, but the party would.

### Surprise Checks
Each side that is not already aware of the other’s presence rolls 1d6.

**Monsters:** The referee rolls for monsters.

**PCs:** One player rolls for the adventuring party as a whole.

**Results:** A result of 1 or 2 means the side is surprised.

### Effects of Surprise
**Both sides surprised:** There is simply a momentary confusion—neither side has any advantage.

**One side surprised:** The side that is not surprised gains a one round advantage. The surprised side cannot act that round.

## Encounter Distance
The situation in which the encounter occurs often determines how far away the monster is. If there is uncertainty, the encounter distance may be determined randomly:

- **Dungeon:** 2d6 × 10 feet.
- **Wilderness:** 4d6 × 10 yards (or 1d4 × 10 yards if either side is surprised).
- **Waterborne:** 4d6 × 10 yards (or 1d4 × 10 yards if either side is surprised).

## Initiative
(See **[[Combat Order]]** for full details.)

**Winner:** The side with the highest roll acts first. 

**Ties:** Either both sides may roll again, or actions on both sides may be resolved simultaneously.

## Actions
### Player Character Actions
The players decide how they will act.

### Monster Actions
The referee determines monsters’ reaction to the party. Sometimes, circumstances make it obvious how a monster will react. Otherwise, the referee may roll on the table below to determine how a monster reacts to the party.

**Charisma:** If one specific character attempts to speak with the monsters, that character’s NPC reactions modifier due to CHA (see **[[Ability Scores]]**) is used to modify the monster reaction roll.

### Monster Reaction Roll

| 2d6        | Result                    |
| ---------- | ------------------------- |
| 2 or less  | Hostile, attacks          |
| 3–5        | Unfriendly, may attack    |
| 6–8        | Neutral, uncertain        |
| 9–11       | Indifferent, uninterested |
| 12 or more | Friendly, helpful         |

> Definitely revisit.

### Common Actions
Any action is possible in an encounter, but the following are common:

- **Combat:** If one side attacks, casts spells, or makes tactical movement, begin tracking time in rounds, following the combat procedure (see **[[Combat Order]]**).
- **Evasion:** If one side decides to flee, the other may decide to pursue. See **Evasion** below.
- **Parley:** PCs may attempt to communicate with monsters. Opening an encounter in this way can influence the monsters’ behaviour (see **Monster Actions** above). If both sides decide to talk, the negotiation may be role-played.

## Movement
**Encounter movement rate:** During encounters, a character can move up to one third of their base movement rate per round in feet (in the dungeon) or yards (in the wilderness). For example, a character whose base movement rate is 120’ could move 40’ per round during a dungeon encounter.

**Maximum duration:** Characters may move at this rate for at most 60 rounds (one turn).

## Evasion
If one side wishes to avoid an encounter, it may attempt to flee. This is called evasion and is only possible before combat has begun. When a side decides to attempt an evasion, the opposing side must decide whether or not to pursue.

**Players:** May decide freely whether they wish to pursue fleeing monsters.

**Monsters:** The referee must decide whether monsters pursue fleeing PCs. (A low roll on the Monster Reactions table may be taken to indicate that the monster will pursue.)

**No pursuit:** If the opposing side decides to let the other side flee, then the evasion automatically succeeds; the encounter is avoided.

**Pursuit:** If the opposing side gives chase, the chance of the evasion succeeding depends on the environment being explored. See **[[Evasion and Pursuit]]**.

## Conclusion
An encounter is assumed to take at least one full turn (10 minutes) to complete, including time to rest, regroup, clean weapons, bind wounds, and so on, afterwards.
