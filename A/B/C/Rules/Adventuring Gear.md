### Descriptions

**Backpack:** Has two straps and can be worn on the back, keeping the hands free. Holds up to 400 coins.<!-- #Revisit -->

**Crowbar:** 2–3’ long and made of solid iron. Can be used for forcing doors and other objects open.

**Grappling hook:** Has 3 or 4 prongs. Can be used for anchoring a rope.

**Hammer:** Can be used for construction or as a mallet with iron or wooden spikes.

**Holy symbol:** A divine spell caster is required to own a holy symbol of their deity, often worn as a necklace. Each religion has its own holy symbol.

**Holy water:** Water that has been blessed by a holy person. It is used in some religious rituals and inflicts damage on undead monsters (see [[Weapons And Armour|Weapon Combat Stats]]). <!-- #Revisit -->Holy water does not retain its power if stored in any other container than the special vials it is blessed in.

**Iron spikes:** May be used for wedging doors open or shut (see [[Dungeon Adventuring]]),<!-- #Revisit --> as an anchor to attach a rope to, and many other purposes.

**Lantern:** Can be closed to hide the light. Burns one oil flask every four hours (24 turns). Casts light in a 30’ radius.

**Mirror:** Useful for looking around corners or for reflecting a gaze attack.

**Oil flask:** A flask of oil fuels a lantern for four hours (24 turns). In addition to fuelling lanterns, oil can be used as a weapon:

- **Throwing:** An oil flask may be lit on fire and thrown (see [[Weapons And Armour]]). <!-- #Revisit -->
- **Pools:** Oil that is poured on the ground and lit covers a diameter of 3 feet and burns for 1 turn, inflicting damage on any character or monster moving through the pool.
- **Immunity:** Burning oil does not harm monsters that have a natural flame attack.

**Pole, 10’:** A 2” thick wooden pole useful for poking and prodding suspicious items in a dungeon.

**Stakes and mallet:** A wooden mallet and three 18” long stakes. Valuable when confronting vampires.
