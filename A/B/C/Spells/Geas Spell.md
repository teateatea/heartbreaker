## Geas
___
**Casting time:** 1 action ***(once per moon).***

*The caster ensorcells a victim with a geas, a terrible malison enforcing an inescapable command.*

**The command can be to do a long or difficult task,** *like "kill Razor the Monk" or "complete the sevenfold pilgrimage" or "bring me the Globe of the Wonder-Working King from the hoard ofthe Caliph Vathek" or "go away".*

The target can **save to resist**, but if they fail the caster's sigil will instantly appear on them *(making this a very quick sigil spell to cast, while keeping in with the one-sigil-per-spell limit):* from then any day that is not spent fulfilling the geas will give to the victim one of the following megrims:
1) **Loss of a level.**
2) **Loss of 1d6 stat points.**
3) **An incurable, evident disease** *(e.g.: leprosy, gout, pox, porphyria, deep melancholia, etc).*
4) **Loss of pleasure** *(e.g.: all foods taste like ashes, all drinks like vinegar, not enjoy music or friends).*
5) **Loss of mean** *(e.g.: money loss, business lost, property damaged, all caused by random non-malicious events).*
6) **One of their close relatives or friends suffer a random megrim.**

For any day that the victim works toward fulfilling the geas, one of these accrued megrims will resolve as if it never were there.

A side effect of the geas is that the victim is **empowered by the geas**: depending on the Referee they gain some power, like seeing in the dark, breathe water, or something more akin to a spell effect.

At any point the geas must be doable, even if it is way above the means and possibility of the victim: **should it become impossible** *(following the examples above: if Razor should die in other ways, or one of the Seven Shrines be destroyed, or the Orb suddenly explode and release the 1001 demons bound inside),* **the geas immediately ends.**

**Should the victim or the caster die,** and perchance even brought back from beyond the pale, or turned to unlife, **the geas remains in effect.**

**This spell cannot be cast more than once per moon.**
