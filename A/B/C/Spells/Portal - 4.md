## Portal
___
**Casting Time:** 1 [[Exploration turn|Turn]] per sigil.
**[[Spell Ranges|Range]]:** Inscribing sigils is [[Touch (Spell Range)|Touch]].
**Target:** Two doors.
**Duration:** [[Sigils|Sigils (Semi-permanent)]]; *see below for more details.*

The caster places a portal sigil on two doors, and by the casting of this spell connects them so that they become the same door as long as the sigils endure.

A traveller stepping into one steps out of the other, with directionality of travel governed by the facing of the sigil *(travellers enter toward the sigil and exit from it)*.

This spell only works on doors of established essence, and is permanent, but closing the door after it has been opened from the sigil side destroys the enchantment and the sigils.
