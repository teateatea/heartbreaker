## Length of a String
___
**Casting Time:** 1 action.
**Target:** 1 continuous piece of rope, string, or other woven cord.
**[[Spell Ranges|Range]]:** Line of sight, 300'.
**Duration:** $L$ turns.

The caster can extend or reduce the length of a rope up to $L$ $\times$ 300 feet.

The rope isn't stretched nor elastic, this spell simply makes the rope longer *(or shorter)* as needed. The caster may continue altering the rope's length for the duration of this spell.

When this spell ends, if the rope is still elongated beyond its original length, it unravels into long, impossibly narrow and very weak fibres.

For a turn the caster can extend or reduce the rope up to 100 yards per level. Itâ€™s not stretched nor elastic, the spell simply makes the rope longer (and shorter) as needed, and only when wanted. If still elongated at the end ofthe spell, the rope unravels into long, impossibly narrow and very weak fibres.
