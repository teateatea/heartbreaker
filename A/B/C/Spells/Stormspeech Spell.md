## Stormspeech
___
**Casting Time:** 1 action.
**[[Spell Ranges|Range]]:** Burst, up to $L$ miles.
**Duration:** $L$ turns.

The sorcerer may command the weather, though only in generalities such as summoning powerful winds, occluding the sun with dark storm clouds, or causing a downpour.

Invariably any weather modifications will result in threefold retribution as the skies become enraged by mortal interference and reassert dominance in days to come.

Stormspeech is most commonly used for speeding ships on placid seas, as the seafaring sorcerer will likely be far away from the cosmic rebalancing when it comes.
