___
*Maestros cast magic through the study of the [[The Wae Sho - The Caspian Philosophy-Art|Wae Sho]], a [[The Wae Sho - The Caspian Philosophy-Art|Caspian philosophy-art]]. It appears as a performance, like conducting the world, or dancing intention into being.*

<!-- has taught them how to cast spells. Maestros are able to cast a greater number of increasingly powerful spells as they advance in arcane ability.*
-->
## Starting Equipment
- Spellbook (containing *Maleficence*, and 2 additional Spells).
- 2 [[Dagger|Daggers (1d4)]].
- An arcane oddity (rolled after choosing Starting Spells).
___
## Summary of Spontaneous Magic
This page is a summary of Spontaneous Magic, describing what you need to know to get started as a Maestro. Links on this page generally reference **[[Spontaneous Magic]]**, which covers the full rules. When you need to draw upon more than your fair share of mana, see **[[Greedy Magic]]**.
___
### Spellbooks
*Spellbooks are mundane instruction books, like dancing manuals or music sheets, describing the necessary steps to shape mana into truths.*

**At 1st Level, you gain a [[Prepared Magic#Spellbooks|Spellbook]], containing all the [[Spells]] you can [[Prepared Magic#Preparing Spells|Rehearse]] before each adventure.**

You may choose to leave your Spellbook at home. You've practiced the Spells within it enough that you don't need it, unless you want to switch to a different collection of spells.

___
### Starting Spells
*Spells are woven from the Weave, a web of energy inherent in all things.*

**At 1st Level, your [[Prepared Magic#Spellbooks|Spellbook]] contains *Maleficence,* and 2 additional [[Spells]].**

**Roll d12 & d8, twice.** Choose either of the rolled spells: Your Spellbook now contains that Spell, allowing it to be **[[Prepared Magic#Preparing Spells|Prepared]]**. Repeat this process to choose your second Spell.


##### Specialists
You may choose to focus on one type of magic, allowing you to gain some benefits when Casting Spells from your Specialty *(see below for details)*. 

When determining Spells randomly, you may instead choose to roll d8 on the Spell List pertaining to your Specialty.

In exchange for these benefits, you must forsake a Specialty: You may never cast, or learn spells from this forbidden category.

> For example, Misa is a 3rd level Maestro. She chose to forsake all access to Cunning Craft, in exchange for greater ability with Elementalism. When learning spells, she may roll d12 & d8 (rerolling any Cunning Craft spells), or she can roll d8 for specifically Elementalism spells.

##### Levelling Up
**Each time you gain a Level, add 2 Spells to your Spellbook,** using the above process. Reroll duplicate spells.

___
### Spell Slots
*Maestro draw mana from three sources: From the Soul, From the Sun, and From the Land.*

**You have Mana Dice, the resource you use to cast Spells.** Mana dice are d6's, and you should use 3 different colours to distinguish the 3 different Sources.

##### Mana From the Soul
**You gain a number of Mana Dice from your Soul, equal to your Maestro Level.**

After being consumed, these dice are replenished after a night's rest.

##### Mana From the Sun
You gain 1 Mana Die from the Sun, but it's only available while you can see daylight.

This die is always available while you can see daylight, but more than one use per day is considered offensive to the Sun.

##### Mana From the Land
You gain 1 Mana Die from the Land, available as long as the area around you is not mana-barren.

This die is generally available, but more than one use per day can strip mana from the land around you. Moving to a new location prevents this concern.

As a general rule, if you cast a Spell From the Land, you should walk some 1,000-1,500 feet *(300-500 meters)* before drawing upon the Land again.

> Misa is a 3rd level Maestro. She has 3 purple dice (Mana From the Soul), a yellow die (From the Sun), and a green die (From the Land).
> 
> She uses the green die (Land) regularly as she travels, and starts using the purple dice (Soul) as she explores dungeons.

___
### Rehearsing Spells
**You spend a week [[Prepared Magic#Preparing Spells|Rehearsing]] Spells from your [[Prepared Magic#Spellbooks|Spellbook]], usually before the adventure.**

**You may rehearse up to $L$ $\times$ 2 Spells**, where $L$ is your Level in Maestro.

**You cannot cast Spells you have not Rehearsed.**
### Casting Spells

**When Casting a Spell, roll one or more Mana Die.**

**For each die that rolls 4, 5, or 6, you gain a +1 bonus to $L$ for the purpose of casting that Spell.**

**For each die that rolls a 6, you have overdrawn mana:**
- **From the Soul:** This die can't be used again until after a night's rest.
- **From the Sun:** If this die is used again today, that result is a **Solar Affront**.
- **From the Land:** This area is mana-barren for the next d20 days.

> For example, Zizard is a **3rd** Level Wizard, who prepares **Acid Arrow** into her **2nd** Circle Spell Slot. When she casts it, her $L$ equals **5**, meaning she'll roll 5d4 acid damage.

### Choral Feedback
You may continue casting Spells you've rehearsed as long as you have the $MD$ to cast it. However, repeating Spells can produce unpredictable feedback from the Weave.

If the Spell you are Casting is the same as the last Spell you Cast, **save vs Spells.** On a fail, roll for **Spell Catastrophe**.
