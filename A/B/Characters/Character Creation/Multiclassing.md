___
At each level, you may choose to train as a different class than your own. 

**Primary class** - Your main class, or your starting class. Each character can only have one Primary Class.
**Secondary class(es)** - Any new classes when multiclassing.

___
# XP Requirements
To level up in your Secondary Class, you'll need the XP requirement for one level higher than the target level. For example, a Magic-User normally needs 5,000 XP to reach 3rd level. If Magic-User is your Secondary Class, you instead need 10,000 XP to get to 3rd level.

___
# Levelling Up
Use these steps when levelling up a secondary class.

### 1. Ability Score Increase*
At every *even* level *(2, 4, 6, etc)*, gain +1 to any one Ability Score.

### 2. Roll Hit Points (HP)
Roll your all Hit Dice for this Level (using the relevant dice for all your Classes), plus your CON $\times$ Total Levels. If the result is higher than your current HP, set this as your new Max HP. 

> Shrimp is a 3 level Fighter, with 2 levels in Magic-User. He rolls 3d8 (for his Fighter levels) plus 2d4 (for his Magic-User levels), plus CON $\times$ 6.
>
> 3d8+2d4+([2] $\times$ 6) for his new Max HP.

### Multiclassing to Fighter
- You may optionally choose to **a)** note your Attack Bonus as the Deed Die for this Fighter level, or **b)** note all your Saving Throws as those for this Fighter level.
- Choose a Discipline to train, and progress to the next step and gain new Abilities: First **A**, then **B**, then **C**, and finally **D**.
- Gain 1 item from that Discipline's starting equipment. 
- Starting at step **B**, gain a Ken at each step of this Discipline.

### Multiclassing to Wizard
- You may optionally choose to **a)** note your Attack Bonus as that from this Wizard level, or **b)** note all your Saving Throws as those for this Wizard level.
- Gain a Spellbook if you don't already have one.
- Gain 1 Spell Slot at each Wizard level.
- Learn 1 Spell from the Grimoire of Classical Arcana.
- See the [[Wizard|Wizard class]] for details about Magic, such as adding new Spells to your Spellbook.

___
# Tracking Experience Points (XP)
**Track XP for each Class separately.** When you gain XP, you may allocate it to any Class.

Once your character's XP reaches the threshold set by either Class Level table, they gain a Level in that Class.

*For example, if you have 3 levels in Fighter, and 1 in Wizard, you could level up when you reach 8,000 XP in Fighter, or 2,500 XP in Wizard.*

# Switching Primary and Secondary Classes
A Character may choose one of their Secondary Classes to replace their Primary Class.

- Their old Primary Class is now a Secondary Class. They keep the same level and XP in that Class, but the XP Requirement to reach to the next level is now set as if it were one level higher *(as usual for Secondary Classes)*.

> Palestrina is a 4th level Fighter, with 2 levels in Magic-User, and decides to focus on magic. When this happens, she remains a 4th level Fighter. To get to 5th level now, she will need 32,000 XP instead of 16,000 XP.

- In their Secondary Class, they remain the same level, but reset their XP to 0 for the purposes of levelling. When they next level up, treat that Class as their Primary Class, and follow the usual procedures described in **[[3) Levelling Up|Levelling Up]]**.

> Palestrina was already a 2nd level Magic-user, with 5,000 XP. She remains 2nd level, but will need to gain 5,000 XP again to reach 3rd level.

> **N.B:** When she reaches 3rd level, she *may* note both her Attack Bonus and Saving Throws as a Magic-User, but in this case she would probably choose to wait (because her 4th level Fighter scores would be better than 3rd level Magic-User).
> 
> As her Primary Class, she can note both AB and ST, or neither; she cannot choose only one.
