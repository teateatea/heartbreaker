# INVOCATIONS
You are a **Mystic**, your actions need no explanation.

When you wish something to happen, roll below.

| | 4d6 | Invocation                              |
|---| ----- | --------------------------------------- |
|| 18-24 | Success                                 |
|| 15-17 | **Situational or Minor Devotion**       |
|| 13-14 | **Major Pact**                          |
|| 7-12  | **Inopportune Favour**                  |
|| 4-6   | **Brilliant Manifestation of Divinity** |

**Invocations** begins the moment a result is accepted. **Favour** may be offered to reroll dice, but each reroll causes a one Round delay.<!-- The **Liturgies** of your faith are a contextual guide to the levels of power solicited during an Invocation.-->
<!--**Favour** may be offered to reroll an Invocation:-->

- ***Before rolling,*** offer any number of Favour points. You may reroll up to that many dice.
- ***After rolling,*** if the total result is more than 12, you may offer Favour points to reroll that many dice, but each die can only be rerolled once.

<!--***Each reroll*** adds one Round to the time needed to invoke your wishes. Invocations begin this Round if no rerolls are made.

####  Duration
If your Invocation has an ongoing effect, or you receive an Inopportune Favour, roll below to determine how long it lasts. When the time ends, you can offer another Favour point to roll Duration again and prolong the effect.-->
##### Duration
If your Invocation has an ongoing effect, roll *Duration* to determine how long it lasts.

| d12   | Duration                 |
| -----: | ------------------------ |
| 12    | d6 Days *(1-6 days)*       |
| 10-11 | d6 Turns *(10-60 minutes)* |
| 1-9   | d6 Rounds *(6-36 seconds)* |

When an Invocation ends, you may offer a Favour point to roll *Duration* again and prolong the effect.

___
##### *Situational or Minor Devotion*
Your Invocation's success requires something immediately obvious that would please Vymjir, or roll *Minor Devotion*.

| d6  | Minor Devotion                           |
| --- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Promise of a pleasing offering.          |
| 2   | Short-term abstinence or indulgence.     |
| 3   | Manifest something holy from your flesh. |
| 4   | Perform a sacred ritual.                 |
| 5   | Recount your deeds (offer d4 Favour).    |
| 6   | Mindless, uncontrollable worship. Roll *Duration.*         |

<!--##### *Religious Fever*
Mindless, uncontrollable worship until the duration ends.-->
##### *Major Pact*
You must agree to undertake a quest or something equally weighty for Vymjir in order for the Invocation to be successful. If you already have one unfinished and you roll another, the Invocation simply fails.

##### *Inopportune Favour*
You are honoured with a manifestation of Vymjir's blessing, though the timing could be better. If you offered Favour for the *Invocation* roll, the blessing is permanent. Otherwise, roll *Duration*.

Gain d4 points of Favour.

##### *Brilliant Manifestation of Divinity*
Your body shreds in the birthing of a terrible avatar of **Vymjir, God of Fate & Forbidden Knowledge**.<!-- If this is a Restore/Purge roll, the target erupts instead.--> Roll *Duration* for the avatar's lifespan, then roll up a new Character. <!-- #Revisit Mystic Avatar -->


___
# FAVOUR

- Take written notes while researching.
- Share useful, actionable knowledge.
- Perform a sermon.
- Reveal a secret to those who don't know it.

***5 Points of Favour***

- Teach or be taught a new subject.
- Convert a disciple to the Seven Tenets.

· Create an intelligent undead.

___
# LITURGIES <!-- Set Liturgy categories -->
The **Liturgies** of your faith are a guide to the levels of power solicited during an Invocation.

<!--If your level is lower than the requirement for a given Liturgy, you must offer a 
number of Favour points equal to double the levels you are missing to attempt to invoke it. Favour offered this way doesn't grant re-rolls.-->

### The First Liturgy
*Mystic Level 1*<br>In the order of the manifestation of pen and paper, learning the location of books known to mortal librarians, and beseeching curious minds to aid in research.

### The Second Liturgy
*Mystic Level 4*<br>In the order of the perception of secrets, speaking with the recently deceased, and invoking minor aspects of **Vymjir, God of Fate & Forbidden Knowledge**.

### The Third Liturgy
*Mystic Level 7*<br>In the order of the manifestation of mundane skeletons and corpses, the bestowal of major aspects of the **Restless One**, and the application of blessings or curses.

### The Fourth Liturgy
*Mystic Level 10*<br>In the order of protection from physical harm, manipulating the souls of others, and raising up to $L$ + $F$ corpses as soul-less [[Minions|minions]].* ->

\**$L$ equals your Level, and $F$ equals the Favour offered for this invocation.*

### The Fifth Liturgy
*Mystic Level 13*<br>In the order of rendering the body ageless, or choosing any result when rolling on a random table.
<br><br>

To solicit a Liturgy beyond your Level, offer Favour equal to *double* the Levels you are missing. Favour offered this way does not grant rerolls.

___
# ABILITIES
### Oversight
*Denomination Bonus*<br>You are only loosely bound by fate. Once per day, you may reroll any one die after seeing the result. You retain this effect indefinitely.<!--When rolling on a random table, you may choose to reroll after seeing the result. You retain this effect indefinitely. -->

You lose *Oversight* if you willfully and unjustly encroach upon the freedoms of another. Regain *Oversight* by performing or observing a sermon.

### *Create Vessel*
As a full round action, you may impart a fragment of your soul to a corpse-minion you can touch. Give them any number of your HD, then choose a rollable total from those dice as their HP. Reduce your Max HP by the same amount.<!--reroll Max HP for both yourself and your Vessel> *(but do not change your Current HP)*. -->


Vessels have basic survival instincts, and can move and make regular attacks in combat. However, they automatically fail Death Saves, and more complicated actions require direct commands. 

As an action, Vessels can be commanded to use traits or abilities they had in life. Vessels with HD equal or greater to those on their Stat block can use their abilities independently *(counting each \* as 1 additional HD)*.

When a Vessel is reduced to 0 HP, your soul fragments return at dawn: regain their HD and add their Max HP to yours. 


### *Deny Fate*
You have forsaken Death completely. When you are reduced to 0 HP, do not roll Death Saves. Instead, you may choose any standing Vessel. All of your current HD transfer to that Vessel when it next sees the sky. If you don't have any Vessels or no Vessels will be transferred to in the near future, roll up a new Character.

You may also attempt to heal wounds, sickness, and curses at any time. Roll *Benevolence*, using Favour in the same manner as Invocations.

| 4d6   | Benevolence (Invocation)                |
| ----- | --------------------------------------- |
| 18-24 | **Restore/Purge**                       |
| 15-17 | **Restore/Purge** & **Bestowed Mark**   |
| 13-14 | **Bestowed Mark**                       |
| 7-12  | **Malpractice**                         |
| 4-6   | **Brilliant Manifestation of Divinity** |
 
If the target of your healing is a disciple of the Seven Tenets, you may re-roll one die without using Favour.

___
##### Restore/Purge
The target is healed for 1d4 per Mystic Level, or one temporary condition is resolved.

##### *Bestowed Mark*
Vymjir's influence manifests as a mutation or phantasm attached to the target. If you offered Favour for the *Benevolence* roll, the mark is permanent. Otherwise, roll *Duration*.

##### *Malpractice*
Oh, gosh, this isn't quite what you meant to happen. Take a look at the DM, they're rolling on a table now. This isn't good.

##### *Brilliant Manifestation of Divinity*
The target of your healing erupts in the birthing of a terrible avatar of **Vymjir, God of Fate & Forbidden Knowledge**. Roll *Duration* for the avatar's lifespan, then have the appropriate Player roll up a new Character.
