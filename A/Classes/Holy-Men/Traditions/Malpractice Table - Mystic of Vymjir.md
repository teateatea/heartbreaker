|  1  | A word describing the Target is burned onto their skin, inflicting 1d4 damage as it's branded.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |     |
|  2  | The ritual succeeds, but the Target begins rotting, causing an increasing -1 penalty to physical rolls every Turn. After 3 turns, their movement is halved. After 6 turns, they count as Undead, and can no longer heal naturally.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |     |
|  3  | The Target's eyes blacken, as do all their body fluid *(blood, tears, spit, etc)*. Roll *Duration*: For that Duration, the Target does not benefit from magical healing or cures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |     |
|  4  | The ritual succeeds, but the Target no longer produces discernible body heat.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |     |
|  5  | If the Target cannot see the sky right now, they take 1d4 damage. Roll *Duration:* For that Duration, the Target suffers 1d4 damage for every turn they cannot see the sky.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |     |
|  6  | The ritual succeeds, but Target can only read words they can touch. They can now read any language they've heard spoken.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |     |

| 16- | Target is subject to a permanent effect or alteration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |     |
| 17  | Skeletal arms reach out of the ground, pulling all creatures within 30' into a giant stoney jaw. Each creature must **save vs Paralysis**, or be swallowed (then **save vs Death** each round they are being chewed by the earth.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |     |
| 18- | The ritual succeeds, but the target is subject to a progressing condition. The target must save vs. Poison every day to prevent the condition progressing, taking a penalty to physical rolls for every stage it advances. To completely recover, the target must make 3 saves in a row, if they fail a save it regresses to its initial condition, and if they fail 3 times in a row the condition results in their spectacular death. Any healing from a Mystic of the same religion during this time will actually progress the condition. |     |
| 19  | The Mystic can feel the weight of infinite knowledge pressing against their mind, and and must **save vs Death.** If they fail, Vymjir removes them from the stream of existence, leaving behind a stack of books containing all of the Mystic's knowledge written in impossible language.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |     |
| 20  | The ritual succeeds, but next time the Target sleeps, they must **save vs Death.** If they fail, their soul is moved to a unknown Vessel of Vymjir. Roll up a new character.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |     |
