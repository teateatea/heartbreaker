*Dedicated to the study of combat, you take violent work as a means of developing your skill. You seldom have the clarity to realize that your relationship with your sword is more important than your relationship with any other person.*
<!--Your skill with a saber is only outmatched by your ability to induce ire in your foes. You'll stop at nothing to be recognized for your devilish escapades.

You look out for yourself at all costs.

___
### [[Discipline A Abilities|A.]] Desperate Dodge
Once per combat, you may drop 1d4 items to negate the damage of an incoming attack *(treat this as if the attack missed)*. These items are randomly selected from among what you are carrying, other than your held weapon and any armor. If you do not have enough items to drop, you fail to dodge.

### [[Discipline A Abilities|A.]] Find the Opening
When attacking foes who attacked you on their last turn, you strike against their unarmoured AC, and deal +1d6 damage.


### [[Discipline B Abilities|B.]] Bronze Tongue
You can speak with metal weapons of all types, and have a natural affinity with all blades.

### [[Discipline C Abilities|C.]] Alloy
You can freely mix materials in any weapon you forge or reforge, introducing new attributes with each. See below for details, and a list of materials.

### [[Discipline D Abilities|D.]] ‘Til Death Do We Part
As long as you are holding a sword of your own power, you may ignore fatal wounds.

* **Grazing:** May spend 4 hours grazing instead of eating a ration.

|                |  Unencumbered                 |       |                      |  Encumbered                 |                   |                      |

### Alloy Smithing Materials
When forging a weapon, first choose a Base material: Copper, Iron, or Mithril. Copper is found cheaply in most settlements, and Iron is available in any settlement with a growing economy. Mithril is more exotic, and is usually found only in major cities.

A weapon forged from only a single base material *(i.e. an iron sword)* is treated as a regular weapon, that you created.

You may additionally choose up to $L$ additional materials, to imbue the weapon with the benefits associated with each material *(i.e. silver does additional damage to magical creatures)*.

For each additional material beyond the first, your weapon gains 1 Brittleness. While using the weapon, any To-Hit roll equal to or less than the weapons Brittleness shatters the weapon, in addition to any other effects. If you can collect all of the weapon’s pieces after it shatters, it can be reforged.

> For example, you forge an Iron Sword (0), adding Gold (1) and Zinc (2). The resulting sword has 2 Brittleness.
> 
> If you attack with this sword, and roll 1 or 2, the weapon shatters. If you're somehow in a situation where a 2 hits your target, you still deal damage as it shatters *(and possibly +1d6 damage due to the Gold)*.

Materials can only exist in a weapon if the base is added first. For example, a weapon needs to have Copper, Iron (1), and Mithril (2) in order to add Antimony (3), Aluminum (4), and Phosphorus (5), resulting in 5 Brittleness. This can result in rather unreliable weapons.

| COPPER BASE          | Prevent first weapon shatter.                                                             |

| 3. Bismuth           | Weapon is reflective as a mirror.                                                         |
