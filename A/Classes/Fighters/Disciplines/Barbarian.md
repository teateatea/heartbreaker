___
*You are from Foreign Parts. You have seen many things, and yet the people Around Here are still strange to you, and their customs are unusual (and sometimes amusing). They fear you, but you know they are right to defer when disagreements arise.*
<!--Your skill with a saber is only outmatched by your ability to induce ire in your foes. You'll stop at nothing to be recognized for your devilish escapades.

You look out for yourself at all costs.

### [[Discipline A Abilities|A.]] Rage
You can choose to enter a Rage at the start of your turn, or in response to taking damage. You can do this a number of times equal to your Bonus to HP *(usually CON + $2$ from Barbarian)*.

<!--You might scream and froth, or stare in battle-focus, or merely let a facade drop and give in to ancient urges, brutal warrior training, or religious fanaticism.-->

While Raging, you gain +$1$ Attack, +$1$ Melee Damage, and are immune to pain and fear. You cannot do anything defensive or curative, and you must attack every turn if possible. <!--or tactical with your allies. All you can do is
attempt to kill things. -->Spellcasting is not impossible, but your Spells must be damaging,<!-- which deal +2
damage (if single target) or +1 damage
(if multiple targets). --> and you must **Save vs Spells** for each Spell to avoid Spell Catastrophes. <!--Mishaps and
Dooms-->

You stop Raging when you have killed, subdued, or driven off all your enemies. Alternatively, at the start of your turn, you can will yourself to stop Raging as a free action, with an $L$-in-6 chance of success. If one of your allies has injured you this fight, they count as an enemy *(and must be killed if you cannot will yourself to stop raging)*.

*($L$ is the number of levels you have taken in Barbarian.)*

### [[Discipline A Abilities|A.]] Danger Sense
If you are surprised, you have a 50% chance to act on the surprise round anyway.

If you encounter a creature no one in the group has seen before, you can roll under your Intelligence to remember a detail or weakness, provided the creature is not unique.

### [[Discipline B Abilities|B.]] A Taste of Home
You spend 1 round consuming a special ration to regain 1d6+$1$ HP. You cannot do this while raging, but you may immediately enter a rage after consuming the ration. If an ally waves the ration under your nose, you make a CON check to wake up immediately to consume the ration.

Examples include an alcoholic drink, a strange fruit or vegetable, or an unusual herb. Each ration costs 1 GP and can be purchased in any trading city. A single inventory slot holds 3 doses. 

### [[Discipline C Abilities|C.]] Feat of Strength
As a free action $L$ times per day, your Strength score counts as 22 for $L$ rounds. This can be used during combat, and your Strength Bonus for Melee attacks is +$4$.

### [[Discipline C Abilities|C.]] Tough
Reduce all incoming damage by $1$ point. You gain a +$2$ to Save vs
mind-altering spells.

### [[Discipline D Abilities|D.]] Blood for Blood
Once per day, you may reroll a failed **Save vs Death**. If you are able to kill the source of the Death save, this ability is refreshed.

<!-- if you fail a Death saving throw, you may immediately choose to reroll it. If you are able to kill the
source of the Death saving throw, this
ability is refreshed. -->

<!--Based on the Barbarian by Skerples from Coins and Scrolls.-->
