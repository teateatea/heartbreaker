___
*Wizards study the [[Principia Arcana]], the most advanced paradigm taught by the Torian [[Phandalin Schola Legio Arcana (PSLA)|Schola Legio Arcana]]. Their spells are a menagerie of diverse spell-creature-bullets, bound and controlled by the soul.*

### Starting Equipment
- Spellbook, with 2 Spells
- Dagger
___
# Arcane Magic
This page describes what you need to know to get started as a Wizard. Consider it to be a summary of your abilities.

When specific interactions governed by magic interest you, see **[[Prepared Magic]]** for the full details.

When you need to draw upon your full capabilities (without regard for safety), see **[[Unleashed Magic]]**.

___
### Starting Spells
**At 1st Level, the Wizard's Spellbook contains 2 Spells.**

Roll 2d100. The GM will show you two Spells. Choose one of the two spells: Your Spellbook now contains that Spell, allowing it to be Prepared. The other Spell is discarded. Repeat this process to choose your second Spell.

##### Levelling Up
**Each time the Wizard gains a Level, they add 2 Spells to their Spellbook.**
___
### Spell Slots
<!-- *How many spell-creatures can you feed with your soul-energy?*-->
The Wizard has [[Prepared Magic#Spell Slots|Spell Slots]], indicating the number of [[Prepared Magic#Spells|Spells]] they can safely Prepare each day. See the ***Wizard Spells per Day Table*** below.

___
### Spellbook
*Spellbooks are arcane menageries, prisons filled with magical spirits.*

The Wizard has a [[Prepared Magic#Spellbooks|Spellbook]], which contains all their [[Spells]]. They [[Prepared Magic#Preparing Spells|Prepare Spells]] from their Spellbook each morning.

##### Adding Spells to Spellbooks
Assuming a well-stocked magical laboratory, this process is laborious, but largely uncomplicated. Without appropriate facilities, double the duration required.

Make a WIS check vs DC 10. On a success, the following duration is measured in days. On a failure, the following duration is measured in weeks *(as the Spell resists being bound by you specifically).*

Roll $L$d6+INT, then subtract from 20. The result is the number of days or weeks required to add this Spell to the Spellbook. 

___
## Preparing Spells
The Wizard must spend an hour to Prepare Spells from their Spellbook, usually in the morning. To Prepare a Spell more than once, the Wizard's Spellbook must contain multiple copies of that Spell. 

Wizards cannot Cast Spells they haven't Prepared, but they may Over-Prepare, binding more spells to themselves than their souls can actually feed. *(This carries associated risks.*) *See Over-Preparing Spells.*

##### Empty Spellpages
*The spell-creature has been bound to the Wizard's soul, and no longer occupies the spellbook.*

Once a Wizard has Prepared a Spell, that Spell cannot be Cast or Prepared by any Magic-User, until the dawn after the Wizard Casts it. Wizards interfere with other Wizards in this way, but non-Wizard Magic-Users have no effect on the Wizard's ability to Prepare Spells.

___
## Casting Spells
Once a Prepared Spell is Cast, it becomes unavailable until the next dawn *(when the Wizard may again Prepare that Spell from their Spellbook).*

##### Conjure Calamity
At any time, a Prepared Spell may be consumed Conjure Calamity, instead of Casting regularly.

*See also: Spontaneous Casting.*

##### Spell Scrolls
<!--~~Spell Scrolls are akin to individual entries in the Wizard's Spellbook, but are less durable.~~-->Spell Scrolls function identically to Spellbooks, with the following exceptions:
- When Preparing Spells from a Scroll, make an WIS check. On a failure, the Scroll is destroyed.
- When Spontaneous Casting from a Scroll, the Scroll is destroyed.

___
##### Cantrips
*Parlour tricks.* 

<!--The Wizard may benefit from minor magical effects related to the spells they have prepared, without actually expelling the spell *(i.e. casually lighting a pipe while Fireball is prepared).*-->

The Spells a Wizard has Prepared allows them to produce Cantrips, minor magical effects akin to parlour tricks. These must be related in theme or ability to the Prepared Spell, but are otherwise undefined and the Wizard is free to imagine their own uses:
- A Wizard with *Fireball* Prepared might casually light his pipe. 
- A Wizard with *Rampant Growth* might produce roses for a date.
- A Wizard with *example here.*

Cantrips are subject to GM approval, but in general, they are significantly weaker than Spells, and the effects should not require a roll.
<!--%*, indicating how many spell-creatures they can safely feed soul-energy. %Start with 2 rolled, then choose 1 at first level.*-->
<!--*temporarily binding the spell-creatures to their brains.*-->
<!-- - % Multiple copies of a spell are required for the wizard to prepare a spell more than once. *(If your spellbook only contains one Light spell-creature, you cannot cast it twice.)*-->
