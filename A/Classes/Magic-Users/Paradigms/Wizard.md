*Wizards study the [[Principia Arcana]], the most advanced paradigm taught by the Torian [[Phandalin Schola Legio Arcana (PSLA)|Schola Legio Arcana]]. Their spells are a menagerie of diverse spell-creature-bullets, bound and controlled by the soul.*
___
### [[Prepared Magic]]
*Spells, enchantments, ghosts, and souls are all more or less the same, living creatures ranging widely in strength and intelligence. Wizards train the ability to bind these magical "anima" to their brains: A well-trained brain is a mind-gun loaded with spell-bullets.*

- The Wizard has a [[Prepared Magic#Spellbooks|Spellbook]], from which they [[Prepared Magic#Preparing Spells|Prepare Spells]].
- The Wizard has a number of [[Prepared Magic#Spell Slots|Spell Slots]], indicating how many [[Prepared Magic#Spells|Spells]] then can safely Prepare each day. <!--%*, indicating how many spell-creatures they can safely feed soul-energy. %Start with 2 rolled, then choose 1 at first level.*-->
- The Wizard must spend an hour to Prepare Spells from their Spellbook *(usually in the morning)*. <!--*temporarily binding the spell-creatures to their brains.*-->
- To Prepare a Spell more than once, the Wizard's Spellbook must contain multiple copies of that Spell. 
	<!-- - % Multiple copies of a spell are required for the wizard to prepare a spell more than once. *(If your spellbook only contains one Light spell-creature, you cannot cast it twice.)*-->
- Once a Prepared Spell is Cast, it becomes unavailable until the next dawn *(when the Wizard may again Prepare that Spell from their Spellbook).*
- At any time, a Prepared Spell may be consumed Conjure Calamity, instead of Casting regularly.
- The Wizard may benefit from minor magical effects related to the spells they have prepared, without actually expelling the spell *(i.e. casually lighting a pipe while Fireball is prepared).*
- Wizards cannot Cast Spells they haven't Prepared, but they may Over-Prepare, binding more spells to themselves than their souls can actually feed. *(This carries associated risks.*) See *Over-Preparing*.
