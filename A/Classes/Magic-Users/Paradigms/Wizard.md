___
*Wizards study the [[Principia Arcana]], the most advanced paradigm taught by the Torian [[Phandalin Schola Legio Arcana (PSLA)|Schola Legio Arcana]]. Their spells are a menagerie of diverse spell-creature-bullets, bound and controlled by the soul.*

### Starting Equipment
- Spellbook, with 2 Spells
- Dagger
___
# Arcane Magic
This page is a summary of Arcane magic, describing what you need to know to get started as a Wizard.

When you're interested in specific interactions governed by magic, see **[[Prepared Magic]]** for the full details.

When you need to draw upon your full capabilities (without regard for safety), see **[[Unleashed Magic]]**.


___
### Spellbooks
*Spellbooks are arcane menageries, prisons filled with magical spirits.*

The Wizard has a [[Prepared Magic#Spellbooks|Spellbook]], which contains all their [[Spells]]. They [[Prepared Magic#Preparing Spells|Prepare Spells]] from their Spellbook each morning.
___
### Starting Spells
**At 1st Level, the Wizard's Spellbook contains 2 Spells.**

Roll 2d100. The GM will show you two Spells. Choose one of the two spells: Your Spellbook now contains that Spell, allowing it to be Prepared. The other Spell is discarded. Repeat this process to choose your second Spell.

##### Levelling Up
**Each time the Wizard gains a Level, they add 2 Spells to their Spellbook.**
___
### Spell Slots
<!-- *How many spell-creatures can you feed with your soul-energy?*-->
The Wizard has **[[Prepared Magic#Spell Slots|Spell Slots]]**, indicating the number of **[[Prepared Magic#Spells|Spells]]** they can safely Prepare each day. See the ***Wizard Spells per Day Table*** below.

___
## Preparing Spells
**The Wizard must spend an hour to Prepare Spells from their Spellbook, usually in the morning.**

**To Prepare a Spell more than once, the Wizard's Spellbook must contain multiple copies of that Spell.**

**Wizards cannot Cast Spells they haven't Prepared,** but they may choose to [[Unleashed Magic#Over-Binding|Over-Bind]], binding more spells to their souls than they can actually feed. *(This carries associated risks.*)

___
## Casting Spells
Once a Prepared Spell is Cast, **it becomes unavailable until the next dawn** *(when the Wizard may again Prepare that Spell from their Spellbook).*

### Conjure Calamity
At any time, a Prepared Spell may be consumed to Conjure Calamity, instead of Casting it regularly.

![[Conjure Calamity#Conjure Calamity]]


___
## Cantrips
<!-- ##### *Parlour tricks.* -->
<!--The Wizard may benefit from minor magical effects related to the spells they have prepared, without actually expelling the spell *(i.e. casually lighting a pipe while Fireball is prepared).*-->

A Wizard's Prepared Spells allow them to produce Cantrips: minor magical effects, akin to parlour tricks. These must be related in theme or ability to the Prepared Spell, but are otherwise undefined. The Wizard is free to imagine their own uses:
- A Wizard who prepared *Fireball* might casually light his pipe with a snap. 
- A Wizard with *Rampant Growth* might produce flowers as a gift.
- A Wizard with *Butterfly Hurricane* might show a butterfly to a child.

Cantrips are subject to GM approval, but in general, they are significantly weaker than Spells, and the effects should not require a roll.
<!--%*, indicating how many spell-creatures they can safely feed soul-energy. %Start with 2 rolled, then choose 1 at first level.*-->
<!--*temporarily binding the spell-creatures to their brains.*-->
<!-- - % Multiple copies of a spell are required for the wizard to prepare a spell more than once. *(If your spellbook only contains one Light spell-creature, you cannot cast it twice.)*-->
