___
*Wizards study the [[Principia Arcana]], the most advanced paradigm taught by the [[Phandalin Schola Legio Arcana (PSLA)|Phandalin Schola Legio Arcana]]. Their spells are a menagerie of diverse spell-creature-bullets, bound and controlled by the soul.*

## Starting Equipment
- Spellbook, with 2 Spells
- 2 [[Dagger|Daggers (1d4)]]
___
## Summary of Prepared Magic
This page is a summary of Prepared Magic, describing what you need to know to get started as a Wizard. Links on this page generally reference **[[Prepared Magic]]**, which covers the full rules. When you need to draw upon your full capabilities, see **[[Unleashed Magic]]**.
___
### Spellbooks
*Spellbooks are arcane menageries, prisons filled with magical spirits.*

**The Wizard has a [[Prepared Magic#Spellbooks|Spellbook]], containing all the [[Spells]] they can [[Prepared Magic#Preparing Spells|Prepare]] each morning.**
___
### Starting Spells
*Spells, enchantments, ghosts, and souls are all more or less the same, living creatures ranging widely in strength and intelligence.*

**At 1st Level, the Wizard's [[Prepared Magic#Spellbooks|Spellbook]] contains 2 [[Spells]].**

**Roll d100 twice.** Choose one of the rolled spells: Your Spellbook now contains that Spell, allowing it to be **[[Prepared Magic#Preparing Spells|Prepared]]**. Repeat this process to choose your second Spell.

##### Levelling Up
**Each time the Wizard gains a Level, they add 2 Spells to their Spellbook.** You may add duplicates of Spells you already have.
___
### Spell Slots
*Wizards train the ability to bind these magical "anima" to their brain: A well-trained brain is a mind-gun loaded with spell-bullets.*

<!-- *How many spell-creatures can you feed with your soul-energy?*-->
The Wizard has **[[Prepared Magic#Spell Slots|Spell Slots]]**, indicating the number of **[[Prepared Magic#Spells|Spells]]** they can safely **[[Prepared Magic#Preparing Spells|Prepare]]** each day. See the ***Wizard Spell Slots per Day Table*** below.

Spell Slots are described by their Circle, indicating the amount of soul-energy allocated to them.

> Wizard initiates wield 1st Circle Spells, while powerful casters might wield 5th, or even 6th Circle Spells.

##### Wizard Spell Slots per Day Table

| Level / Circle | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   |
| ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1     | 1   | -   | -   | -   | -   | -   |
| 2     | 2   | -   | -   | -   | -   | -   |
| 3     | 2   | 1   | -   | -   | -   | -   |

*[[Wizard#Wizard Spell Slots per Level Table continued|Table continued below.]]*

___
### Preparing Spells
**The Wizard must spend an hour to [[Prepared Magic#Preparing Spells|Prepare Spells]] from their [[Prepared Magic#Spellbooks|Spellbook]], usually in the morning.**

For each available Spell Slot, choose a Spell from your Spellbook. When Casting that Spell, you gain a bonus to $L$ equal to the Circle of that Spell Slot.

> For example, Zizard is a **3rd** Level Wizard, who prepares **Acid Arrow** into her **2nd** Circle Spell Slot. When she casts it, her $L$ equals **5**, meaning she'll roll 5d4 acid damage.

**To Prepare a Spell more than once, the Wizard's Spellbook must contain multiple copies of that Spell.**

**Wizards cannot Cast Spells they haven't Prepared,** but they may choose to **[[Unleashed Magic#Over-Binding|Over-Bind]]**, binding more spells to their souls than they can actually feed. *(This carries associated risks.*)

**Once a Prepared Spell is Cast, it becomes unavailable until the next dawn** *(when the Wizard may again Prepare that Spell from their Spellbook).*

___
### Cantrips
<!-- ##### *Parlour tricks.* -->
<!--The Wizard may benefit from minor magical effects related to the spells they have prepared, without actually expelling the spell *(i.e. casually lighting a pipe while Fireball is prepared).*-->

A Wizard's Prepared Spells allow them to produce Cantrips: minor magical effects, akin to parlour tricks. These must be related in theme or ability to the Prepared Spell, but are otherwise undefined. The Wizard is free to imagine their own uses:
- A Wizard who prepared *Fireball* might casually light his pipe with a snap. 
- A Wizard with *Rampant Growth* might produce flowers as a gift.
- A Wizard with *Butterfly Hurricane* might show a butterfly to a child.

Cantrips are subject to GM approval, but in general, they are significantly weaker than Spells, and the effects should not require a roll.
<!--%*, indicating how many spell-creatures they can safely feed soul-energy. %Start with 2 rolled, then choose 1 at first level.*-->
<!--*temporarily binding the spell-creatures to their brains.*-->
<!-- - % Multiple copies of a spell are required for the wizard to prepare a spell more than once. *(If your spellbook only contains one Light spell-creature, you cannot cast it twice.)*-->
___
### Conjure Calamity
At any time, a Prepared Spell may be consumed to Conjure Calamity, instead of Casting it regularly.
