# Fire-Proof Armour
*A letter comes from Phandalin, in Tor.*

> Mr. Tumon,
> 
> We would be delighted to explore the options available to a man of your stature, and sincerely believe that you will be more than satisfied with the pieces we can provide. Please find the descriptions of several items that may fit your needs below.
> 
> If you require immediate protection, please choose a Ring as they do not require bespoke assembly, and can be sent immediately.
> 
> Yours,
> [[Melina of House Revere]]

___
### **Ring of Fire Resistance**
**Cost: 2,000 GP**
Grants the wearer protection against fire.
- **Normal fire:** Unharmed by non-magical fire.
- **Save bonus:** Gain a +2 bonus to all saving throws versus fire-based magical or breath attacks.
- **Fire-based damage:** Is reduced by 1 point per damage die rolled. (Each die inflicts a minimum of 1 hit point damage.)
___
### **Ring of Superior Fire Resistance**
**Cost: 10,000 GP**

Grants the wearer protection against fire.
- **Normal fire:** Unharmed by non-magical fire.
- **Save bonus:** Gain advantage to all saving throws versus fire-based magical or breath attacks.
- **Fire-based damage:** Is halved. (Each die inflicts a minimum of 1 hit point damage.)
___
### **Cold Iron Plate Armour** (AC 16, 6 slots)
**Cost: 20,000 GP & 6-8 weeks**

Grants the wearer protection against fire.
- **Normal fire:** Unharmed by non-magical fire.
- **Fire Resistance:** Gain advantage to all saving throws versus fire-based magical or breath attacks.
- **Fire-based damage:** Is halved. (Each die inflicts a minimum of 1 hit point damage.)
- **Cold Iron Helmet:** Gain advantage to all saving throws versus [[Enchantment Magic|Enchantments and Charms]] of [[Fae]] origin.

**Iron Sclerite:** As an action, you may activate your armour. For up to $R$ turns per day, fire damage you take is reduced to 0.
- **Elemental Energy:** This armour is powered by Elemental cores. There are 6 slots in the back of the armour, one of which is already filled.
	- A Water Imp Core is included in the price: +1 $R$
	- The Resistance gained ($R$) is equal to the HD of the cooling Elemental whose core has been connected to the suit.
	- Elemental cores work best if their source is cooling (*e.g. Water, Ice, Alcohol).* Some secondary Elements may work suboptimally *(e.g. Ooze, Ink, Mud),* and can be expected to provide $R$ equal to half their HD.

### Cold Iron Plate Armour - Considerations
#### Heroic Armour (passive)
**Cost: 5,000 GP, +10 days**
The articulated gorget projects a nearly-invisible protective bubble over the wearers head. No need for a helmet, show off that pretty face!

*Replaces Cold Iron Helmet.*

#### Guilded Armour
**Cost: 1,000 GP, +2 days**
Any style of decoration you desire!

#### Hermetic Seal (with activation)
**Cost: 1,000 GP, +1 day**
Necessary if you intend to be submerged in lava, as opposed to only walking through fire.

#### Breathing Spell (with activation) 
**Cost: 1,000 GP, +1 day**
Necessary if you intend to spend time in any space without air, for longer than you can hold your breath *(e.g. raging infernos, lakes of lava).*
- Uses 1 Core Slot, lasting $B$ turns.
	- The Breathing gained ($B$) is equal to the HD of the air Elemental whose core has been connected to the suit.

#### Additional Elemental Cores
- **Water Imp Cores:** +1 Resistance (500 GP).
- **Water Elemental Cores:** +4 Resistance (2,000 GP).
- **Air Imp Core:** +1 Breathing (500 GP).
- **Air Elemental Core:** +4 Breathing (2,000 GP).
