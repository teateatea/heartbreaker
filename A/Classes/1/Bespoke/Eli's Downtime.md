# A Key
*A letter comes from [[Tal'Arrar]], in Tor.*

> Ms Eli of the Martels,
> 
> We would be most honoured to accommodate your request. As you know, teleportation magic varies dramatically in scope, so a range of options have been provided for you below.
>
> We have included quotes for spell scrolls which you may find sufficient for your goals. These do not require our expertise, and can be ordered through our partners in the Yellow City.
> 
> You will find two Key designs, one by our own Sanctum Esoterica, and the other by our partners, the [[Shushan Sanctum Esoterica]]. Either would facilitate your returns from abroad with elegance.
> 
> Lastly, though it may come as a surprise to you, we do provide Permanent Teleportation Circle installations as well. We understand the Martel Companies business needs, and guarantee strict secrecy and privacy in these matters. We would be remiss to overlook such an exciting opportunity.
> 
> [[Novalli of the Sanctum Esoterica|Novalli Cosp]], [[Arcanotect]] Liaison
> [[The Sanctum Esoterica|The Tal'Arrar Sanctum Esoterica]]
