**Note from Jo:** I realize this is a lot of text lmao. I'm happy to summarize it in person, this one kind of got away from me.
# A Key That Takes Me Home
*A letter comes from [[Tal'Arrar]], in Tor.*

> Ms Eli of the Martels,
> 
> We would be most honoured to accommodate your request. As you know, teleportation magic varies dramatically in scope, so a range of options have been provided below.
>
> We have included quotes for spell scrolls which you may find sufficient for your goals. These do not require our expertise, and can be ordered through our partners at the [[Shushan Scaena Esoterica]] (due to your shared affinities, of course).
> 
> You will find two Key designs, one by our own Sanctum Esoterica, and the other by our Yellow City partners. Either would facilitate your returns from abroad, and come with our guarantee of non-interposition.
> 
> Please note, however, that this type of magic interacts with Gates in extremely unpredictable ways. We recommend thoroughly assessing any door before use, to avoid magical catastrophes.
> 
> Lastly, though it may come as a surprise to you, we do provide Permanent Teleportation Circle installations as well. We understand the Martel Companies' business needs, and guarantee strict secrecy and the utmost privacy in these matters. We would, however, be remiss to overlook such an exciting opportunity, without advocating for our more advanced services.
> 
> Humbly,
> [[Novalli of the Sanctum Esoterica|Novalli Cosp]], [[Arcanotect]] Liaison

___
### Portal Spell Scroll (1,850 GP)
**Casting Time:** 1 [[Exploration turn|Turn]] per sigil.
**[[Spell Ranges|Range]]:** Inscribing sigils is [[Touch (Spell Range)|Touch]].
**Target:** Two doors.
**Duration:** [[Sigils|Sigils (Semi-permanent)]]; *see below for more details.*

The caster places a portal sigil on two doors, and by the casting of this spell connects them so that they become the same door as long as the sigils endure.

A traveller stepping into one steps out of the other, with directionality of travel governed by the facing of the sigil *(travellers enter toward the sigil and exit from it)*.

This spell only works on doors of established essence, and is permanent, but closing the door after it has been opened from the sigil side destroys the enchantment and the sigils.

---
### Revisitation Spell Scroll (2,400 GP)
**Casting Time:** Full round action; 1 [[Exploration turn|Turn]] to inscribe the Return Sigil.
**[[Spell Ranges|Range]]:** 10 foot [[Burst|burst]].
**Target:** Up to $L$ creatures.
**Duration:** [[Sigils|Sigils (Semi-permanent)]]; *see below for more details.*

A number of medium creatures up to the Caster's Level are transported to the location of the Caster's Sigil of Return.

The Sigil of Return must be scribed under the gaze of the sun and is destroyed if moved from its place of inscription.

Carried and worn possessions are conveyed as well, though there is a 50% chance that any awkward or cumbersome object is left behind.

Unwilling creatures may **save vs spells** to resist.
___
### Traveller's Key & Hearthlock (18,000 GP & 4-6 weeks)
#### Hearthlock / Hearthdoor
This deadbolt functions as a regular door lock, but also acts as a permanent portal anchor. The door this is installed into is called the Hearthdoor.

The lock has two sides: Gold on the exterior, wrought iron on the interior.

#### Traveller's Key / Traveller's Door
The Traveller's Key is connected to a single Hearthlock, and can be used as a mundane key to unlock the lock's gold exterior face.

When the Hearth Key is pushed into a flat, vertical surface, a door matching the size and shape of the Hearthdoor appears, with a gold lock around the Key. This is the Traveller's Door, and can be unlocked, and opened.

While the doors are open, any creature stepping through the Traveller's Door steps out of the Hearthdoor, and vice versa. (Creatures that enter towards the gold side exit from the wrought iron side, as if they were the same door.)

Once the key is removed, and the door closed, the Hearthdoor will function as a mundane door again, and the Traveller's Door is locked, but does not disappear. The two doors remain linked, and knocking on the Traveller's Door will be heard from the Hearthdoor. Unlocking the Hearthdoor from the wrought iron interior will lead back to the last Traveller's Door that was opened.

Only one Traveller's Door exists at a time, but it can change locations.
___
### Suin-Key (28,000 GP, 6 weeks)
#### Suin-Door
This door functions as a regular door, but also acts as a semi-permanent portal anchor. The door has two sides: Gold filigree on the exterior, electrum trim on the interior.

#### Suin-Key
The Suin-Key is bound to its' paired Suin-Door, and can be used mundanely to unlock that door directly.

When the Suin-Key is inserted into the keyhole of any other door, a gold or electrum trim covers the door as it links to the Suin-Door. Any creature stepping through one door steps out of the other, and vice versa. Creatures that enter toward the gold side will exit from the electrum side, as if they were the same door.

While unlocked, keys appear in the keyholes on both facings of the door (a gold key on one side, an electrum key on the other). The door must be relocked to remove a key, which unlinks that door and returns it to its' original appearance. The other door remains as the Suin-Door.
