___
### Spiteful Blade (1d8)
**Cost: 11,500 GP**

Melee (1d6), Missile (5'-10' / **11'-20'** / 21'-30').

- **Spiteful Arc (1d8):** When thrown, draw a **2 Arc Path** starting from the attacker, then roll to hit each creature in order along that path. The first creature hit receives full damage (1d8), then for each additional hit this turn, step the damage die down once (1d6, then 1d4, then 1d3). The blade stops at the fourth creature hit (who received 1d3 damage), or else lands at the end of the path.
- **$X$ Arc Path:** Draw a path for the blade with $X$ turns, following these two rules for the entirety of this throw:
	- **Consistent Direction:** Each turn must be made to the same side as the first turn.
	- **Irregular Distances:** The blade may travel 15', 20' or 25' before or after turning, but cannot travel the same distance twice in a row.
- **Retribution:** As a reaction on the same round you throw the blade, you may recall the blade. Draw a **1 Arc Path** starting from the blade's current location, then roll to hit each creature as if this were a continuation of **Spiteful Arc.**
- **Catch!** If the blade would come within 5' feet of you, it instead returns to your hands.

**Cost: 5,000 GP**

Melee, Missile (5'-10' / **11'-20'** / 21'-30').
- **Scornful Drive (1d8):** When thrown, draw a line to a visible location within range. Roll to attack each creature in that line, in order from closest to furthest. After the first hit *(and after dealing damage),* the blade comes to a rest behind the hit creature. If another creature is immediately behind the first, it takes 1d6 damage.
- **Retribution:** As a reaction, you may recall your sword. Treat this as a **Drive (1d6),** starting from the blade's current location, targeting your hand. If the blade would come to a rest within 5' feet of you, it instead returns to your hand.

**Cost: 9,500 GP**

Melee, Missile (5'-10' / **11'-20'** / 21'-30').
- **Vengeful Drive (1d8):** When thrown, draw a line to a visible location within range. Roll to attack each creature in that line, in order from closest to furthest. The first creature hit receives full damage (1d8), then for each additional hit, step the damage die down once (1d6, then 1d4, then 1d3). The sword stops at the fourth creature (who received 1d3 damage), or else lands at the target location.
- **Retribution:** As a reaction, you may recall your sword. Treat this as a **Drive (1d6),** starting from the blade's current location, targeting your hand. If the blade would come to a rest within 5' feet of you, it instead returns to your hand.

The sword stops at the fifth creature (who received 1d3 damage), or else lands at the target location.
- **Retribution:** As a reaction, you may recall your sword. Treat this as a **Drive (1d8),** starting from the blade's current location, targeting your hands. If the blade would come to a rest within 5' feet of you, it instead returns to your hands.
