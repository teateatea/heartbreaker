Melee, Missile (5'-10' / **11'-20'** / 21'-30').
- **Scornful Drive (1d8):** When thrown, draw a line to a visible location within range. Roll to attack each creature in that line, in order from closest to furthest. After the first hit *(and after dealing damage),* the blade comes to a rest behind the hit creature. If another creature is immediately behind the first, it takes 1d6 damage.
- **Retribution:** As a reaction, you may recall your sword. Treat this as a **Drive (1d6),** starting from the blade's current location, targeting your hand. If the blade would come to a rest within 5' feet of you, it instead returns to your hand.

The first creature hit receives full damage (1d8), then step the damage die down once for each additional hit (1d6, then 1d4, then 1d3). The sword stops at the fourth creature (who received 1d3 damage), or else lands at the target location.
- **Retribution:** As a reaction, you may recall your sword. Treat this as a **Drive (1d6),** starting from the blade's current location, targeting your hand. If the blade would come to a rest within 5' feet of you, it instead returns to your hand.
