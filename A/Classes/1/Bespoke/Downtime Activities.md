___
Player Characters level up by *spending* their money, not just by recovering treasure. See **[[2) Gaining XP|Gaining XP]]** for more details.

But how does each Character choose to spend their money? *[Some options should be outlined below.]*

___

It's impossible to list every possible way to spend money, so instead, please message me the things you think your Character would spend their money on. *(Please do actually message it to me, because it's easier to stay organized when it's saved somewhere other than my brain lol.)*

___
### [[Broja's Downtime]]
### [[Datmanh's Downtime]]
### [[Eli's Downtime]]
### [[Miss Isle's Downtime]]
### [[Tumon's Downtime]]

The above pages aren't private, but no effort will be made to make them legible to anybody other than the relevant Players.
