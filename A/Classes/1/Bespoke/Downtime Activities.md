___
Player Characters level up by *spending* their money, not just by recovering treasure. See **[[2) Gaining XP|Gaining XP]]** for more details.
___
It's unrealistic to list every possible way to spend money, so instead, please message me what you think your Character would spend their money on. I've provided some prompts and categories below, if you're interested in some suggestions.

**Please do actually message it to me. It's easier to stay organized when it's saved somewhere other than my brain lol.**
___
*These pages are not private, but no effort will be made to make them legible to anybody other than the relevant Players.*
