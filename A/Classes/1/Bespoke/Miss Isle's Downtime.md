# Meeting an Old Pal
*Someone you know joins you at the tavern.*
___
**"Haha! Long time no see, old friend!"**

> Holy shit, you got fat.

**"Six weeks on a tub and I figured there'd be more of reception for me. Not this... disappointing bucket of slop."**

**"Ha, and one those little guard-bees even got uppity with me before I sat his skinny ass back down. Kid hasn't been taught enough lessons in his life, thinking he can stomp around like that."**

**"Yeah, and then his bitch-ass captain tried to give me a talking to, as if *she* was any more threatening than a gopher. With her stupid little *'épée.'*"**

> [Lassie spits on the floor.]

**"Yeah, something about 'deportation,'" as if I really wanted to be here in the first place. Like, fuck, just threaten to kill me you sweaty pig, do you think I'm scared of going home?"**

**"So how the hell did you land yourself in this shit-hole?"**

> *Fuck we trained so much did you just forget how to run?*

**"Does anybody here even have active combat experience? Or you all just wave knives around like a bunch of kids?"**

**"What the fuck did you just say? 'Adventure' my ass, you'll just get yourself killed. You know what, I've made up my mind. I'm going to whip you into shape."**

> *No, an actual shape you lumpy pile of shit. Gods I have so much work to do.*
