### Forms
> *Jo: What is the best name for the different personas? Heads? Minds? Forms? Beasts? Avoid Personalities to differentiate from DID.*

*Chimera-Hosts have multiple Forms, any one of which can take charge of the shared body. Each Form has distinct preferences, mannerisms, and interests from the others.*

They may have up to $L \div 2$ Forms, rounding down *(where $L$ is the Character's total number of Levels)*. <!-- Confusion Alert: Careful, this is *total* levels, rather than Levels in Chimera specifically. Revisit for consistency if this is ever an issue -->

| Level | # of Forms |
| ----- | ------------- |
| 1-3   | 1             |
| 4-5   | 2             |
| 6-7   | 3             |
| 8-9   | 4             |
| 10+   | 5             |

#### Shifting Forms
*Each Form believes they know the best way to accomplish things, and are eager to exert their will upon the world.*

When you roll a d20 for any reason, note the result on the die:
- **If the result is equal to or less than $L$,** then after all relevant actions are completed, you ***Shift.***
	- **If the result is an even number,** you choose which Form has taken control, and may choose the Form that is already in control.
	- **If the result is an odd number,**** roll to randomly determine which Form takes control instead.

> For example, Karkemish is a 6th level Chimera-Host, with 3 Forms. He rolls to strike a foe with his dagger, rolling a d20 to attack. He rolls a 5 *(missing the attack)*, which triggers a ***Shift.*** 
>
> Because it's an odd number, Karkemish rolls a d3 to determine which Form will take control: He rolls a 2, shifting from "The Belligerent" to "The Mendicant" as soon as he finishes his swing, and promptly apologizes for the violence.

> If he had rolled a 2, 4, or 6, a ***Shift*** would have been triggered, but he could have chosen to remain in the same form to continue fighting violently.

#### Focuses
Each Form has their own Focuses, the methods they use to manage Stress *(see below).* When creating a new Form, use the following template:

1. **A Quiet Action**
	- Low energy activity: meditation, singing, reading, cooking, etc.
2. **A Loud Action**
	- High energy activity, or combat action: running, charging, dodging, etc.
3. **A Consumeable**
	- Use something up: specific food or drink, burning wood or candles, etc.


### Stress
> *Jo: Is this the best name for this concept?*
