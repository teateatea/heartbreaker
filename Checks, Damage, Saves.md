___
### Ability Checks
The referee may use a character’s ability scores to determine the character’s chance of succeeding at various challenging tasks.

**Rolling an ability check:** The player rolls 1d20 and, if the result is less than or equal to the ability, the check succeeds. If the roll is greater than the ability, the check fails.

**Modifiers:** Bonuses or penalties to the roll may be applied, depending on the difficulty of the task. A modifier of –4 would be a relatively easy ability check, and a +4 would be very difficult.

**1s and 20s:** An unmodified roll of 1 should be treated as a success and a 20 treated as a failure.

___
### Damage and Healing
All characters and monsters have a hit point total, which represents their ability to avoid death. Many attack forms, including attacks with weapons in combat, subtract hit points from this pool.

##### Death
A character or monster reduced to 0 hit points or less is killed.

##### Destruction of Items
If a character is killed by a destructive spell or special attack (e.g. a lightning bolt spell or a dragon’s breath), their equipment is assumed to be destroyed.

##### Destruction of Magic Items
Magic items in the possession of a character who is killed by a destructive spell or special attack may be allowed a chance to survive, as follows:

* **Save:** For each item, a saving throw may be made using the character’s saving throw values.
* **Bonuses:** Items that grant a bonus in combat (e.g. magical weapons and armour) may also apply this bonus to the saving throw.

##### Healing
**Natural:** For each full day of complete rest, a character or monster recovers 1d3 hit points. If the rest is interrupted, the character or monster will not heal that day.

**Magical:** Healing may also occur through magic, such as potions or spells. This kind of healing is instantaneous. Magical healing and natural healing can be combined.

___
### Saving Throws
All characters and monsters can make saving throws to avoid the full effects of certain magical or special attacks.

##### Categories
There are five saving throw categories, used in the following situations:

* **Death or Poison:** When targeted by a death ray or exposed to poison.
* **Wands:** When targeted by an effect from a magical wand.
* **Paralysis or Petrification:** When targeted by an effect that paralyses or turns to stone.
* **Breath Attacks:** When targeted by the breath of a dragon (or other monster with a breath attack).
* **Spells, Rods, or Staves:** When targeted by a baneful spell or an effect from a magical rod or staff.

##### When to Roll a Saving Throw
The appropriate saving throw to make and the effects of a success or failure are indicated in the description of the spell, monster attack, or adventure scenario.

##### Saving Throw Tables
**Characters:** Each character class has its own table denoting the saving throw values of characters of each experience level.

**Monsters:** Most monsters use the saving throw table under [[Combat Tables]]. <!-- #Revisit -->Some monsters’ descriptions may note that they use the table for a specific character class.

##### Rolling a Saving Throw
When affected by a spell or attack form which requires a saving throw, the player or referee must roll 1d20 and compare the result to the appropriate saving throw value:

* **Greater or equal:** A result that is greater than or equal to the saving throw value is a success.
* **Lower:** A result of less than the saving throw value is a failure.

##### Successful Saves
**Damaging effects:** A successful save against an effect that causes damage means that the damage is halved.

**Other effects:** A successful saving throw against an effect that does not cause damage means the effect has been entirely avoided or negated.

##### Saving Throws Versus Poison
**Failure:** A failed save against poison is usually fatal.

**Damage:** If a poisonous attack also inflicts damage, the damage is not affected by the success or failure of the saving throw.

##### Saving Throws in Different Genres
Genre rules books may specify additional situations that require saving throws and which saving throw category should be used. For example, a genre rules book may specify that exposure to radiation requires a save versus spells.
