To create a new Character, you need a **Character sheet** to record info about your character, and an **Inventory sheet** to record your equipment. You also need a **pencil** to note things down if you're not playing digitally, and a set of **dice** *(**d20**, d12, d10, d8, **3d6**, d4)* to get started.

A **blank map**, and somewhere to keep **notes** will be useful during play, but isn't necessary for now.

- **[[3) OSE - 03-00 - Character Sheet - Double Sided - 2022-03-17.pdf|Printable Character Sheet PDF (March 2022)]]** - *8.5" x 11", Double Sided.*
- *Optional:* **[[OSE - 01-00 - Complete Starter Package (HSI) - 2020-11-26.pdf|Creating a New Character - Printable PDF.]]**
- Additional downloads available on the **[[Resources]]** page.
<!-- #Revisit put the Fillable Character sheet here, with INVENTORY PAGE-->

# The Cards You Were Dealt
### 1. Roll Background & Appearance
Choose or roll a **d20** on each of the ***Background & Appearance*** tables. 

- ***[[OSE - 01-01 - Background & Appearance Tables - 2022-04-26.pdf|Background & Appearance Tables PDF.]]***

![[Character Appearance Example 2022-04-26.png|300]]
<!--*Use the top-right box of your Character sheet for this.*-->
<br>
### 2. Roll Ability Scores
Roll **3d6** for each of your Character’s Ability scores: **Constitution**, **Strength**, **Dexterity**, **Intelligence**, **Wisdom**, and **Charisma**.

*Ability Scores are found in the upper-left of the Character sheet. Use the first boxes to note Ability Scores (the second boxes will be your Bonuses).*

*For more information, see **[[Ability Scores|Ability Scores (OSE, p16).]]*** 

<!-- #### Online Character Generation
Steps 1-3 involve a lot of rolling, so to have those results automatically generated, click here.-->
##### ***a) Sub-Par Characters***
If you roll a Character with very poor Ability scores (either 8 or less in every score, or 6 or less in one score) you may reroll the lowest score.

##### ***b) Adjust Ability Scores***
If you wish, choose any two Ability scores, and swap their scores.

*For example, you could switch your scores for Strength and Intelligence.*

##### ***c) Note Ability Modifiers & Bonuses***
Note the associated bonuses for each Ability score, based on the tables overleaf. 

- ***[[OSE - 01-02 - Ability Scores - 2020-07-20.pdf|Ability Score Bonuses PDF]]*** <!-- #Revisit -->

Modifiers affect other attributes on your Character sheet too, such as Constitution providing a Bonus to your HP. Note those now.

*Each Ability score gives a Bonus to other attributes, such as CON improving your Max HP. Use the second boxes to note your Bonuses now, as well as all the relevant attributes affected by those Bonuses.*

# The Path You Have Taken
### 3. Choose a Class
Your Character's Class describes their role in the adventuring party. Select one of the available **[[home#Classes|Classes.]]**

- **[[Fighter|Fighter]]** ([[Fighter Disciplines|Disciplines]])
- **[[Magic-User|Magic-User]]** ([[Wizard|Wizards]])
- **[[Holy-Man]]** ([[Mystic of Vymjir|Mystics]])

For this step, you will need the **Class Level Progression** table from your Class' page.

##### ***a) Note Level & Experience Points (XP)***
**New Characters begin play at 1st Level, with 0 Experience Points (XP).**

Note the XP required for the **Next Level** too.

**[[2) Gaining XP#Funerals|If a Funeral was held for your previous Character,]]**[[2) Gaining XP#Funerals| your new Character may begin play with XP.]]

##### ***b) Roll Hit Points (HP)***
<!-- Your Level Progression table lists your Hit Dice.-->
**At 1st level, your HP is equal to the highest possible result of your Hit Die, plus your CON Bonus.**

If you are beginning with more than 0 XP, roll all your Hit Dice for your Level, plus your CON $\times$ Level.

Note your Hit Points as equal to your Max HP now too.

##### ***c) Note Attack Bonus (AB)***
<!-- Your Level Progression table lists your Attack Bonus. -->
Note this Bonus as your Attack Bonus, indicating your skill at hitting opponents in combat.

**[[Fighter#Attack Bonus|If you are a Fighter,]]**[[Fighter#Attack Bonus| you have a Deed Die instead of an Attack Bonus.]]

##### ***d) Note Saving Throws***
Note your Saving Throws<!--, listed in the Level Progression Chart for your class-->: **Death**, **Wands**, **Paralysis**, **Breath**, and **Spells**. These indicate your skill at avoiding different categories of danger. <!-- (see ***Saving Throws, OSE p105***).-->

*For more information, see **[[Checks, Damage, Saves#Saving Throws|Saving Throws (OSE, p105).]]***

##### ***e) Note Class Abilities***
Record the special abilities and equipment gained from your **Class**.
- Fighters need to choose their **[[Fighter Disciplines|Discipline.]]**
- Magic-Users need to choose their **[[Wizard|Paradigm]]**.
- Holy-Men need to choose their **[[Sacred Tradition]].**

If you have a Spellbook, ask the GM which Spells are recorded in it. The GM may allow you to choose.

# Your Tools For Survival
### 4. Mark Inventory Space
On your Inventory sheet, draw a horizontal line below the box equal to each ability score. Each box is one Inventory Slot, and lets you carry one item, 500 coins, or bundles weighing around 10 pounds.
<br>
### 5. Roll Debts
Roll three d20s, and place the digits in consecutive order. This is your debt to the Martel Company. 

*For example, if you roll 14, 16, and 8, then your debts amount to 14,168 **[[Money|Silver Pieces (SP)]]**.*
<br>
### 6. Buy Equipment
You have access to the full Martel Armory. You may spend as much money as you wish to equip yourself for adventure. <!--consulting the equipment lists under ***Equipment, p42***.  --> The cost of each item is added to your debt to the Martel Company.

- **[[OSE - 01-2 - Equipment List (HSI) - 2020-11-25 v1-1.pdf|Equipment List PDF]]**

##### ***a) Note Armour Class (AC)***
Your Armour Class (AC) indicates how hard to hurt you are, and is determined by your:
- **Armour:** Your armour determines your base AC. If you have no armour, your base AC is [10].
- **Dexterity bonus:** See **[[Ability Scores|Ability Scores (OSE, p16).]]*** 
<br>
### 7. Get Backup
*If this is your first time ever playing this game, skip this step for now.*

Treasure hunters often band beneath anybody with a decent plan. You may lead a number of retainers up to your level, or your CHA bonus *(whichever is higher)*.



Retainers expect one share of the loot, but accept that PCs get two shares each.<br><br>

# Who Are You?
### 8. Name Character
Finally, choose or roll for your character’s true name, as well as the company name they use on missions.

You are now ready for adventure!
