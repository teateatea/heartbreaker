___
When your character's XP reaches the threshold set by their class level table, they gain a level.

___
### 1. Gain +1 to any one Ability Score
Note the new Bonus if relevant.

If the Bonus changed, make the relevant changes around your Character Sheet now too. For example, DEX affects your AC, Missile Attacks, and Initiative.

| Ability Score | MOD |
| -------------: | --- |
| 3             | -3  |
| 4-5           | -2  |
| 6-8           | -1  |
| 9-12          | +0  |
| 13-15         | +1  |
| 16-17         | +2  |
| 18            | +3  |

___
### 2. Roll Hit Points (HP)
Roll your Hit Dice for this Level, plus [CON $\times$ Level].
- If the total is greater than your current Max HP, set this as your new Max HP.
- If the result is equal to or lower than your current Max HP, add only your CON to your Max HP.
- If the result is still lower than your current HP, increase your Max HP by 1.

> For example, Kena is a Fighter with 13 HP, +2 CON, and is advancing to 3rd Level. 
> - He rolls 3d8 (because he's a Fighter),
> - then adds 6 (+2 CON $\times$ 3rd Level).
>   
> - If the result is greater than 13, that's Kena's new Max HP. If he rolled a total of 11, plus 6, his Max HP would now be 17.
> - If the result is 13 or less, Kena only adds his +2 con, for a Max HP of 15.

___
### 3. Note Attack Bonus and Saving Throws*
You may note both your Attack Bonus and your Saving Throws, as listed in the level progression chart for your class.

\**This only changes every 3-5 levels.*

___
### 4. **Note Class Abilities:**
- **Fighters choose a Discipline to train,** and progress to the next step and gain new Abilities: First **A**, then **B**, then **C**, and finally **D**.
	- They also gain a Ken at each step of their Discipline.
- **Magic-Users gain Spells and Spell Slots.** <!--Revisit-->
