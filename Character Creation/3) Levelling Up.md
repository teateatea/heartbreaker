___
When your character's XP reaches the threshold set by their class level table, they gain a level.

### 1. Gain +1 to any one Ability Score
Note the new Bonus if relevant.

### 2. Roll Hit Points (HP)
Roll your Hit Dice for this Level, plus [CON $\times$ Level]. If the result is higher than your current HP, set this as your new Max HP.

### 3. Note Attack Bonus and Saving Throws*
As listed in the level progression chart for your class.

\**This only changes every 3-5 levels.*

### 4. **Note Class Abilities:**
- **Fighters choose a Discipline to train,** and progress to the next step and gain new Abilities: First **A**, then **B**, then **C**, and finally **D**.
	- They also gain a Ken at each step of their Discipline.
- **Magic-Users gain Spells and Spell Slots.** <!--Revisit-->
