___
At each level, you may choose to train as a different class than your own. 

**Main class** - Your original starting class.<br>
**Secondary class(es)** - Any new classes when multiclassing.

Use these steps when levelling up a secondary class.

### 1. Ability Score Increase*
At every *even* level *(2, 4, 6, etc)*, gain +1 to any one Ability Score.

### 2. Roll Hit Points (HP)
Roll your Hit Dice for this Level, plus your CON $\times$ Level. If the result is higher than your current HP, set this as your new Max HP.

Track HP for each class separately for the purposes of levelling up, but your Max HP is the total from all of your classes.

### Multiclassing to Fighter
- You may optionally choose to **a)** note your Attack Bonus as the Deed Die for this Fighter level, or **b)** note all your Saving Throws as those for this Fighter level.
- Choose a Discipline to train, and progress to the next step and gain new Abilities: First **A**, then **B**, then **C**, and finally **D**.
- Gain 1 item from that Discipline's starting equipment. 
- Starting at step **B**, gain a Ken at each step of this Discipline.

### Multiclassing to Wizard
- You may optionally choose to **a)** note your Attack Bonus as that from this Wizard level, or **b)** note all your Saving Throws as those for this Wizard level.
- Gain a Spellbook if you don't already have one.
- Gain 1 Spell Slot at each Wizard level.
- Learn 1 Spell from the Grimoire of Classical Arcana.
- See the [[Wizard|Wizard class]] for details about Magic, such as adding new Spells to your Spellbook.

### Tracking Experience Points (XP)
After first gaining a Level in a Secondary Class, **track XP for each Class separately.** When you gain XP, you may allocate it to any Class.

Once your character's XP reaches the threshold set by either Class Level table, they gain a Level in that Class.

*For example, if you have 3 levels in Fighter, and 1 in Wizard, you could level up when you reach 8,000 XP in Fighter, or 2,500 XP in Wizard.*
