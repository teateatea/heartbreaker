___
The native languages spoken by a player character are determined by the character’s class. These typically include the common tongue. Characters with high INT may learn additional languages (see [[Ability Scores#Intelligence INT|Ability Scores]]). <!-- #Revisit -->

___
### The Common Tongue
The common tongue *(sometimes simply called Common)* is a language which is widespread among intelligent species. All player character races—as well as many monsters—are able to speak Common.

In some settings, the referee may rule that different cultures in the campaign world have different languages, in which case a particular language must be chosen instead of Common.

___
### Other Languages
Many demihuman and intelligent monster species have their own language, which player characters may be able to learn. The following languages are common and may be chosen by player characters with high Intelligence *(at the referee’s discretion)*:

##### Common Languages
- **Dwarvish**
- **Elvish**
- **Goblin**
- **Kobold**
- **Orcish**
- **Human dialect**

##### Uncommon Languages
- Bugbear
- Doppelgänger
- Dragon
- Gargoyle
- Gnoll
- Gnomish
- Halfling
- Harpy
- Hobgoblin
- Lizard man
- Medusa
- Minotaur
- Ogre
- Pixie
