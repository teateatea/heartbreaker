## Heartbreaker
Hello! This is my custom roleplaying game *(which are often called heartbreaker games)*. The rules are based on Old School Essentials, the Goblin Laws of Gaming, Veins of the Earth, and any other ideas that match my intended game experience.

Thank you for playing!

## [[Open Table]]
I'd like to run games with four players, but there are more than four of you interested in playing! So I'm trying out an open table, where players swap in and out as schedule permits.

To make that work, I'm running ***Hot Springs Island*** as sandbox game rather than a narrative storyline or campaign. Players are encouraged to keep a roster of characters to play, as they're likely to be joining slightly different parties each session.

**See [[Scheduling]] to get started, or [[Open Table|click here for Open Table logistics.]]**

## [[Rules|The Rules]]
We'll be playing [**Old-School Essentials (OSE)**](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/272802/OldSchool-Essentials-Basic-Rules), a remastered 1st Edition Dungeons & Dragons *(B/X D&D)*. The [**online SRD is available here,**](https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/) but I don't expect you to read all the rules before we play. I *do* expect you to read your Character's Features, Abilities and Spells, so that you have an sense of your role in the party.

I’m using **[[Resources#House-Rules|House-Rules]]** whenever the OSE rules don’t match my intended experience. For example, the amount of stuff that you can carry will feature more heavily in this game, than in the average OSE game, so I’ve made adjustments for a more tactile, slot-based inventory system.

I'm following the principles described in the [**Principia Apocrypha**](https://lithyscaphe.blogspot.com/p/principia-apocrypha.html). For example, I'll use *'Rulings Over Rules'* to keep the game moving at the table, rather than strictly following OSE. After the game, we can have a look at what the rules are *supposed* to be. Feel free to remind me about any principles you notice I've forgotten!
