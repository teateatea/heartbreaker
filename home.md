## Heartbreaker
Hello! This is my custom roleplaying game *(which are often called heartbreaker games)*. The rules are based on Old School Essentials, the Goblin Laws of Gaming, Veins of the Earth, and any other ideas that match my intended game experience.

Thank you for playing!

## Rules
In general, we're playing [**Old School Essentials (OSE)**](https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/), a remastered Beginner/Expert Dungeons & Dragons *(1st Edition)*.

I intend to broadly follow the principles describes in the [**Principia Apocrypha**](https://lithyscaphe.blogspot.com/p/principia-apocrypha.html). I'll use *Rulings Over Rules* to keep the game moving at the table, rather than strictly following OSE. After the game, feel free to remind me about any principles you notice I've forgotten.

## House Rules
##### Player Characters
- **Major changes to classes** - See each class below for details.
- **Permanent Death Saves** - PCs die on the 3rd failure of their lifetime.
- **Ability Check vs Difficulty Class** - Improves on-boarding from modern *D&D (5e)*.
- **Slot-based Inventory** - Treasure hauling is a major aspect of the game.
##### General Gameplay
- [[Money]] - Silver Standard *(1 GP = 10 SP = 50 CP)*.
- [[Minions]] - from *Flee, Mortals! by MCDM.*
