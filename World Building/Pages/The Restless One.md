#### Writings:
Many told him it was a path of evil, many of those he travelled with barely trusted him and thought of him as deranged for taking up such dark powers. All he wanted was to find ways to cheat death, and he did not exclude undeath from his research.

Tapping into the powers of death did dampen his formerly sunny demeanour but heightened his resolve to press further into his work; with every life force sapped, with every skeleton re-animated he could feel between his fingertips a clue, a hint, a way out of mortality.
