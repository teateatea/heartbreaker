___
## Death during Casting
If a Wizard dies while Casting a Spell *(regardless of the cause of death)*, immediately roll Spell Catastrophe.
___
## Spontaneous Casting
**Use this when you have Spell Slots available, but no time to Prepare.**

*Wizards must Prepare in order to Cast Spells safely, but some situations call for urgency at any cost.* 

As a full round action, a Wizard may Spontaneously Cast an available Spell from a Spellbook or Spell Scroll, consuming either a Spell Slot or a Prepared Spell. The Wizard must **Save vs Spells**, or suffer a Spell Catastrophe in addition to the intended effects of the Spell. <!--~~This often includes Conjuring Calamity on themselves.~~--> If a Spell Scroll was used, it's destroyed after casting.
___
## Over-Preparing
**Use this to when you have no Spell Slots, but you do have time to Prepare.**

*Some Wizards Prepare beyond their ability to manage soul essence, stepping closer to the edge of mortality.*

While Preparing, the Wizard may **Save vs Death** to Prepare a Spell *without* an available Spell Slot. On a failure, roll Spell Catastrophe. The Spell Catastrophe effects end *(or are reversed)* when that Spell is Cast.
___
## Over-Casting
**Use this when you have no Spell Slots, and no time to Prepare.**

<!--*Wizard magic is limited by the amount of energy they can safely harvest from the soul. As they progress, they harness can more of this energy, more efficiently.*
-->
<!--*Spell Slots represent the number of Spells a Wizard can safely Cast each day, not the full capacity of their soul. Wizards can keep drawing on their soul's energy to Cast, but risk death in doing so.*0-->
*Over-Casting is the combination of Over-Preparing and Spontaneous Casting. The Wizard draws more energy from their soul than they know how to control, and use it to immediately unleash a Spell from its' Book.*

As a full round action, a Wizard may **Save vs Death** to begin a Spontaneous Casting, *without* using an available Spell Slot. On a failure, roll Spell Catastrophe. 

The Wizard then proceeds to **Save vs Spells** for their Spontaneous Casting. On a failure, roll Spell Catastrophe.

*Note that a very unlucky Wizard could produce three Spell Catastrophes:*
1. By failing their Save vs Death to Over-Cast.
2. By also failing their Save vs Spells to Spontaneously Cast.
3. If either of the above Spell Catastrophes result in the Wizard's death.
