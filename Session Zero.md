___
## Lines
Lines are hard boundaries that cannot be crossed for any reason. As far as this game is concerned, these basically don't happen anywhere in the world.

These topics have been emphasized to me by players. I realize that with an open table, not all players will be present at once, but I'm just going to always prepare the game with these in mind (rather than trying to track which players and lines are relevant for any particular session).

##### **[[No animal abuse|No animal abuse.]]**
***Puppies have plot armour.*** More specifically, cute non-sentient creatures cannot be harmed in any way.

##### [[No gratuitous gore descriptions|No gratuitous gore descriptions.]]
**Stay classy.** One sentence is fine, six sentences using a thesaurus is not.

## Veils
Veils are soft boundaries that can be included in the game, but will only be discussed as "off-screen" events, or a fade-to-black if they include the Player Characters.

##### **[[Consentual Sex]]**
**Music plays, someone giggles, fade to black.** It's not really the point of this game but if it makes sense narratively, we'll just say everyone had a great time lol.

##### [[Torture]]
**Every hour, roll for damage, victims roll morale. Information quality falls dramatically with time.** No need to get specific, we can just all agree the torturing agent is an evil person. This can easily escalate past **[[No gratuitous gore descriptions]]** above.

## This Game May Contain The Following Sensitive Topics
**Alcohol, Classism, Drugs, Bullying, Prejudice, Racism, Slavery, Violence, Death, Insects, Death of Parental Figures, Torture, Spiders, Starvation, Sexual Assault, Pandemics, Eye Injuries, Teeth Injuries, Hand injuries, Bug on/in people, Genocide, Natural Disasters, Terrorism.**

### I'm excluding these things
These themes won't exist in games I prepare:

*Rape, Harm to Animals, Graphic Gore, Harm to Children, Suicide, Homophobia, Transphobia, Body Shaming, Pregnancy/miscarriage/abortion.*
