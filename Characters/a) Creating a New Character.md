___
To create a new Character, you need a **Character sheet** to record info about your character, and an **Inventory sheet** to record your equipment. You'll also need a **pencil** to note things down if you're not playing digitally, and a set of **dice** *(**d20**, d12, d10, d8, **3d6**, d4)* to get started.

A **blank map**, and somewhere to keep **notes** will be useful during play, but not necessary for now.

Some or all of these pages can be found on the [[Resources]] page. Let me know if there’s anything you need!

##### ***a) Sub-Par Characters***
If you roll a Character with very poor Ability scores – such as 8 or less in every score, or a 6 or less in one score – you may reroll the lowest score.

##### ***b) Adjust Ability Scores***
If you wish, choose any two Ability scores, and swap their scores.

*For example, you could switch your scores for Strength and Intelligence.*

# The Path You Have Taken
### 4. Choose a Class
Select one of the [[Classes]] available (see ***Character Classes, OSE p22***).

You will need the **Class Level Progression** table for this step of Character creation.<!-- #Revisit -->

###### ***a) Note Level & Experience Points (XP)***
New Characters begin play at 1st Level, with 0 Experience Points (XP). Note the XP required for the next Level too.

If this is not your first Character, [[b) Gaining XP#Funerals|it's possible to begin play with more than 0 XP.]]

##### ***b) Roll Hit Points (HP)***
Your Level Progression table lists your Hit Dice.

**At 1st level, your HP is equal to the highest possible result of your Hit Die, plus your CON Bonus.**

If you are beginning with more than 0 XP, roll all your Hit Dice for your Level, plus your CON $\times$ Level.

##### ***c) Note Attack Bonus (AB)***
Your Level Progression table lists your Attack Bonus. 

Note this bonus as your Attack Bonus, indicating your skill at hitting opponents in combat.

[[Fighter#Attack Bonus|If you are a Fighter, you do not have a fixed AB. Please see your Class page for details.]]

##### ***d) Note Saving Throws***
Note your saving throws, listed in the level progression chart for your class: Death, Wands, Paralysis, Breath, and Spells. These indicate your chance of avoiding different categories of danger (see ***Saving Throws, OSE p105***).

##### ***e) Note Class Abilities***
Record any special abilities gained as a result of your class. If you have a spellbook, ask the GM which spells are recorded in it. The GM may allow you to choose.

# Your Tools For Survival

### 6. Roll Debts
Roll three d20s, and place the digits in consecutive order. This is your debt to the Martel Company.
