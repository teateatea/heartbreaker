___
To create a new character, you need a **character sheet** to record info about your character, and an **inventory sheet** to record your equipment.

A **blank map**, and somewhere to keep **notes** is useful, but optional.

Let me know if there’s anything you need!

___
# The Cards You Were Dealt
### 1. Roll Background & Appearance
Choose or roll a d20 on each of the ***Background & Appearance*** tables. <!-- #Revisit -->
<br>
### 2. Roll Ability Scores
Roll 3d6 for each of your character’s ability scores: Constitution, Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma.

For more information, see ***Ability Scores, OSE p16.***  <!-- #Revisit -->

<!-- #### Online Character Generation

##### ***a) Sub-Par Characters***
If you roll a character with very poor ability scores – such as 8 or less in every score, or a 6 or less in one score – you may reroll the lowest score.

##### ***b) Adjust Ability Scores***
If you wish, choose any two ability scores, and swap their scores.

*For example, you could switch your scores for Strength and Intelligence.*

##### ***c) Note Bonuses***
Note the associated bonuses or penalties for each ability score, based on the tables overleaf. <!-- #Revisit -->

___
# The Path You Have Taken
### 4. Choose a Class
Select one of the classes available (see ***Character Classes, OSE p22***). <!-- #Revisit -->

###### ***a) Note Level & Experience (XP)***
New characters begin play at 1st level, with 0 Experience Points (XP). Note the XP required for the next level too.

##### ***b) Roll Hit Points (HP)***
Your class lists your Hit Dice.

At 1st level, your HP is equal to the highest possible result on that die, plus your Constitution modifier.

##### ***c) Note Attack Bonus***
The level progression chart for your class lists your Attack Bonus. This indicates your chance of hitting opponents in combat.

Note the modifier inside the square bracket as your Attack Bonus.

##### ***d) Note Saving Throws***
Note your saving throws, listed in the level progression chart for your class: Death, Wands, Paralysis, Breath, and Spells. These indicate your chance of avoiding different categories of danger (see ***Saving Throws, OSE p105***).

##### ***e) Note Class Abilities***
Record any special abilities gained as a result of your class. If you have a spellbook, ask the GM which spells are recorded in it. The GM may allow you to choose.

___
# Your Tools For Survival
### 5. Mark Inventory Space
On your inventory sheet, draw a horizontal line below the box equal to each ability score.

Each box lets you carry one item, 100 coins, or bundles weighing around 10 pounds.
<br>
### 6. Roll Debts
Roll three d20s, and place the digits in consecutive order. This is your debt to the Martel Company.

*For example, if you roll 14, 16, and 8, then your debts amount to 14,168 GP.*
<br>
### 7. Buy Equipment
You have access to the full Martel Armory. You may spend as much money as you wish to equip yourself for adventure, consulting the equipment lists under ***Equipment, p42***.

The cost of each item is added to your debt to the Martel Company. <!-- #Revisit -->

##### ***a) Note Armour Class (AC)***
Your Armour Class (AC) indicates how hard to hurt you are, and is determined by your:
- **Armour:** Your armour determines your base AC. If you have no armour, your base AC is [10].
- **Dexterity bonus:** See ***Ability Scores, p16.*** <!-- #Revisit -->
<br>
### 8. Get Backup
Treasure hunters often band beneath anybody with a decent plan. Your Charisma limits the number of retainers you may lead. Each person gets one share, but leaders get two.

___
# Who Are You?
### 9. Name Character
Finally, choose or roll for your character’s true name, as well as the company name they use on missions.

You are now ready for adventure!
