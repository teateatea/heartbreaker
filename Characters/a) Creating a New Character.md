___
To create a new Character, you need a **Character sheet** to record info about your character, and an **Inventory sheet** to record your equipment. You also need a **pencil** to note things down if you're not playing digitally, and a set of **dice** *(**d20**, d12, d10, d8, **3d6**, d4)* to get started.

A **blank map**, and somewhere to keep **notes** will be useful during play, but not necessary for now.

Some or all of these pages can be found on the [[Resources]] page. Let me know if there’s anything you need!

___
# The Cards You Were Dealt
### 1. Roll Background & Appearance
Choose or roll a **d20** on each of the ***Background & Appearance*** tables.

*(Use the top-right box of the Character sheet for this.)*<!-- #Revisit -->
<br>
### 2. Roll Ability Scores
Roll **3d6** for each of your Character’s Ability scores: Constitution, Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma.

*(Ability Scores are found a the top-left of the Character sheet. Use the wider rectangles to note the Ability Scores, and the squares for the Bonuses.)*

<!--For more information, see ***Ability Scores, OSE p16.***   #Revisit -->

<!-- #### Online Character Generation

##### ***a) Sub-Par Characters***
If you roll a Character with very poor Ability scores (either 8 or less in every score, or 6 or less in one score) you may reroll the lowest score.

##### ***b) Adjust Ability Scores***
If you wish, choose any two Ability scores, and swap their scores.

*For example, you could switch your scores for Strength and Intelligence.*

##### ***c) Note Bonuses***
Note the associated bonuses for each Ability score, based on the tables overleaf. ***(Revisit!)***

*(Each Ability score gives a Bonus to other attributes, such as CON improving HP. Go around the sheet and fill in the relevant boxes now.)*<!-- #Revisit -->

# The Path You Have Taken
### 3. Choose a Class
Your Character's Class describes their role in the adventuring party. Select one of the available [[home#Classes|Classes]].

You will need the **Class Level Progression** table for this step of Character creation.<!-- #Revisit -->

##### ***a) Note Level & Experience Points (XP)***
New Characters begin play at 1st Level, with 0 Experience Points (XP). Note the XP required for the next Level too.

[[b) Gaining XP#Funerals|If a Funeral was held for your previous Character, this Character may begin play with XP.]]

##### ***b) Roll Hit Points (HP)***
<!-- Your Level Progression table lists your Hit Dice.-->
**At 1st level, your HP is equal to the highest possible result of your Hit Die, plus your CON Bonus.**

If you are beginning with more than 0 XP, roll all your Hit Dice for your Level, plus your CON $\times$ Level.

##### ***c) Note Attack Bonus (AB)***
<!-- Your Level Progression table lists your Attack Bonus. -->
Note this Bonus as your Attack Bonus, indicating your skill at hitting opponents in combat.

[[Fighter#Attack Bonus|If you are a Fighter, you have a Deed Die instead of an Attack Bonus.]]

##### ***d) Note Saving Throws***
Note your Saving Throws<!--, listed in the Level Progression Chart for your class-->: Death, Wands, Paralysis, Breath, and Spells. These indicate your skill at avoiding different categories of danger. <!-- (see ***Saving Throws, OSE p105***).-->

##### ***e) Note Class Abilities***
Record any special abilities gained as a result of your class. If you have a Spellbook, ask the GM which Spells are recorded in it. The GM may allow you to choose.

# Your Tools For Survival
### 4. Mark Inventory Space
On your Inventory sheet, draw a horizontal line below the box equal to each ability score. Each box is one Inventory Slot, and lets you carry one item, 500 coins, or bundles weighing around 10 pounds.
<br>
### 5. Roll Debts
Roll three d20s, and place the digits in consecutive order. This is your debt to the Martel Company. *For example, if you roll 14, 16, and 8, then your debts amount to 14,168 GP.*
<br>
### 6. Buy Equipment
You have access to the full Martel Armory. You may spend as much money as you wish to equip yourself for adventure, consulting the equipment lists under ***Equipment, p42***.<!-- #Revisit --> The cost of each item is added to your debt to the Martel Company.

##### ***a) Note Armour Class (AC)***
Your Armour Class (AC) indicates how hard to hurt you are, and is determined by your:
- **Armour:** Your armour determines your base AC. If you have no armour, your base AC is [10].
- **Dexterity bonus:** See ***Ability Scores, p16.*** <!-- #Revisit -->
<br>
### 7. Get Backup
Treasure hunters often band beneath anybody with a decent plan. Your Charisma limits the number of retainers you may lead. Each person gets one share, but leaders get two.
