___
At each level, you may choose to train as a different class than your own. Use these steps to level up instead.

Track XP for both classes separately. For example, if you have 3 levels in Fighter, and 2 in Wizard, you should have 4,000 XP in Fighter, and 2,500 XP in Wizard. When your character's XP reaches the threshold set by their class level table, they gain a level.

### 1. Gain +1 to any one Ability Score
Note the new Bonus if relevant.

### 2. Roll Hit Points (HP)
Roll your Hit Dice for this Level, plus your CON $\times$ Level. If the result is higher than your current HP, set this as your new Max HP.

### 3. Note changes in Attack Bonus and Saving Throws
As listed in the level progression chart for your class.

### 4. **Note Class Abilities:**
- **Fighters choose a Discipline to train,** and progress to the next step and gain new Abilities: First **A**, then **B**, then **C**, and finally **D**. They also gain a Ken at each step of their Discipline.
- **Magic-Users gain spells.** <!--Revisit-->
