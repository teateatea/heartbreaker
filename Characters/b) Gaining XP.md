## Spending
*Spending describes goal-driven, useful, or responsible purchases. Examples include weapons, tools, armour, real estate, beasts or vehicles, productive research, and hiring specialists (smiths, sages, engineers), etc.* 

*As a general rule, if the Character would gain specific benefits, that's spending.*

For Gold spent usefully, **gain XP equal to the GP spent.** The size of the settlement determines approximately how much gold can be spent in one week.

| Settlement | Max Gold / Week |
| ---------- | --------------: |
| City       | 100,000 GP     |
| Town       | 10,000 GP      |
| Village    | 1,000 GP       |

## Carousing
*Carousing describes any luxurious or frivolous spending, such as a drinking, partying, indulging in food/drink/drugs, attending theatres, restaurants, brothels, etc. As a general rule, if the Character would gain no specific benefits, that's carousing.*

For Gold spent Carousing, **gain XP equal to *double* the GP spent.** The size of the settlement determines how much gold can be spent in one week. 

| Settlement | Max Gold / Week |
| ---------- | --------------: |
| City       | 100,000 GP     |
| Town       | 10,000 GP      |
| Village    | 1,000 GP       |

For each week you carouse, roll on the Drinking Mishap Table. <!-- #Revisit

## Funerals
If the party brings your corpse back and holds a proper funeral, **they may spend Gold up to your XP.**

If they do, your next character starts with half that XP. The other half of your XP is divided amongst the rest of the party.
