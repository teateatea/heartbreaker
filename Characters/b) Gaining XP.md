You gain Experience Points (XP) by spending Gold.
___
## Carousing
For Gold spent Carousing *(drinking, partying, frivolous spending*), you gain XP equal to the GP spent. The size of the settlement determines how much gold can be spent in one night. 

| Settlement | Max Gold / Night |
| ---------- | --------------: |
| City       | 100,000 GP     |
| Town       | 10,000 GP      |
| Village    | 1,000 GP       |

For each night you carouse, roll on the Drinking Mishap Table. <!-- #Revisit -->

___
## Funerals
If the party brings your corpse back and holds a proper funeral, they may spend Gold up to your XP. If they do, your next character starts with half that XP. The other half of your XP is divided amongst the rest of the party.
