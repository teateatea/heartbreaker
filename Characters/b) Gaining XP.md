You gain Experience Points (XP) when you spend [[Money|money]]. The size of the settlement determines approximately how much money can be spent by the party in one week.

| Settlement | Max Silver / Week |
| ---------- | --------------: |
| City       | 100,000 SP     |
| Town       | 10,000 SP      |
| Village    | 1,000 SP       |

## Spending
*Spending describes goal-driven, useful, or responsible purchases. Examples include weapons, tools, armour, real estate, beasts or vehicles, productive research, and hiring specialists (smiths, sages, engineers), etc.* *As a general rule, if the Character would gain specific benefits, that's spending.*

**For money spent usefully, gain XP equal to the SP spent.** 

## Carousing
*Carousing describes any luxurious spending where the Character would gain no specific benefits. Examples are limited only to the imagination, but include throwing lavish parties or celebrations, making donations to churches / charities / orphanages, personal trainers / private fencing lessons / private chefs, university books / academic research, and indulging in food / drink / drugs, attending theatres / restaurants / brothels / vacations, etc.*

**For money spent carousing, gain XP equal to *double* the SP spent.**

<!-- For each week you carouse, roll on the Carousing Mishap Table.

## Funerals
**If the party brings your Character's corpse back to civilization, and holds a proper funeral, they may spend SP up to your XP.**

If they do, XP equal to the SP spent is divided amongst the surviving party members. Additionally, your next Character begins play with XP equal to the SP spent.
