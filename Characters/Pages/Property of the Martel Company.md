##### ***An introduction to the Hot Springs Island***
[[home|Home]] | [[a) Creating a New Character|Character Creation]]
___
You are brand-new adventurers. Treasure hunters. Haulers. You might have been something else before, but not anymore. You are *Property of the Martel Company* now, and they expect returns on their investments.

They’ve trained you for the one thing they care about: Hauling treasure.<br>“Leave nothing behind,” they said, “no matter what.” Pick it up and move it, so that when you die, it’ll be closer for the next team.

But, it’s in their interest that you succeed, so you’ve had additional training based on your dispositions, aptitudes, and the needs of your party.

You may be a ***[[Fighter]]***. One day, you will have mastered every form of combat and war, and you will be an unstoppable force. But for now, you slay monsters and you keep your team alive.

You may be a ***[[Magic-User]]***. Your abilities border on the unfathomable to your team, but the risk you represent is clear to all. For now, you untangle the weird problems.

You may be a ~~***Thief***~~. You intend to sneak past Death when she comes for you, and your team doesn’t realize that you’re serious. For now, you exploit weaknesses in traps, locks, and men.

We’ll be playing Old School Essentials (OSE), a modern adaptation of Basic/Expert Dungeons & Dragons (B/X D&D). My goal is to make this a ‘sandbox’ game, meaning there is no predetermined story arc. Instead, you’re encouraged to make your own goals, and we’ll explore the results of your decisions in the world and the
world’s reactions to you.

In general, I’m going to make it clear when you’re about to make a ‘no turning back’ kind of decision. This is mainly to ensure we’re on
the same page about the situation, and possible outcomes of your actions. *(“Okay, so just to confirm, you want to freedive head-first into this pitch-black hole? You can’t see the bottom.”)* The major exception here is when you’re making your first character: Don’t worry, you’ll be allowed to undo or adjust basically every decision you make during that process. Just pick something and let’s start playing.

I’m using house-rules whenever the game rules don’t match my intended experience. For example, the amount of stuff that you can carry will feature more heavily in this game, than in the average OSE game, so I’ve made adjustments for a more tactile inventory system.

Last but not least, you should know that the only way to gain Experience Points (XP) is by selling treasure back to the Martels. Killing monsters will only grant you XP if you bring valuable carcasses home.

1 Gold Piece = 1 Experience Point
