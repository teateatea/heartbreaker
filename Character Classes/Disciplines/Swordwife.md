*Dedicated to the study of combat, you take violent work as a means of developing your skill. You seldom have the clarity to realize that your relationship with your sword is more important than your relationship with any other person.*
<!--Your skill with a saber is only outmatched by your ability to induce ire in your foes. You'll stop at nothing to be recognized for your devilish escapades.

You look out for yourself at all costs.

___
### [[Discipline A Abilities|A.]] Desperate Dodge
Once per combat, you may drop 1d4 items to negate the damage of an incoming attack. These items are randomly selected from among what you are carrying, other than your held weapon and any armor. If you do not have enough items to drop, you fail to dodge.

### [[Discipline A Abilities|A.]] Find the Opening
When attacking foes who attacked you on their last turn, you strike against their unarmoured AC, and deal +1d6 damage.


### [[Discipline B Abilities|B.]] Bronze Tongue
You can speak with metal weapons of all types, and have a natural affinity with all blades.

### [[Discipline C Abilities|C.]] Alloy
You can freely mix materials in any weapon you forge or reforge, introducing new attributes with each. See below for a list of materials.

For each additional material beyond the base, your weapon gains a point of Brittleness. Upon rolling a 1 to make an attack roll with the weapon, it shatters but still deals damage. For each further point of Brittleness, this range increases by 1. If you can collect all of the weapon’s pieces, it can be reforged.

### [[Discipline D Abilities|D.]] ‘Til Death Do We Part
As long as you are holding a sword of your own power, you may ignore fatal wounds.

___
##### Alloy Smithing Materials
Copper base materials are easily found in most settlements, while mithril base materials are more exotic, and usually found only in major cities.

Choose a base. A weapon forged from just the base (i.e. an iron sword) has 0 Brittleness, and no risk of shattering. For each additional material (including other bases), the weapon gains 1 Brittleness, and shatters if you roll less than or equal to Brittleness.

Materials can only exist in a weapon if the base is added first, which can make for unreliable weapons. For example, a weapon that has Antimony, Aluminum, and Phosphorus would need to have Copper, Iron, and Mithril, resulting in 5 Brittleness.
