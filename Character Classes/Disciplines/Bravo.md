### [[Discipline A Abilities|A.]] Whirling Blade
Each time an attack targets only you, but misses, you gain +1 AC. This bonus resets to 0 when you take a short rest.

### [[Discipline B Abilities|B.]] Charming Bastard
Once per combat, when you miss an attack, grin and taunt your target. The opponents roll Morale: On a success, the nearest $L$+1 opponents spend their turn moving to encircle you, but only the nearest opponent can attack you. If their attack misses, you may use this ability again next round.

*(L is the number of levels you have taken in Swashbuckler.)*

### [[Discipline C Abilities|C.]] Sacrifice
When any source of damage would reduce you to 0 HP, you may sacrifice an adjacent ally to escape. That ally must Save vs Death: On a success, they take the damage instead. On a fail, they take damage until their HP is equal or lower than yours.

Your ally may instead choose to die for you. If they do, gain a level.

### [[Discipline D Abilities|D.]] Song of Swords
Once per day, you can make swords sing. You and each ally may immediately make a melee attack, even if you or they have already attacked this round. If your allies cannot attack, they may instead move towards an enemy, even if they have already moved this round. 

For each ally that attacks due to this effect, you gain +1 AC until the end of your next round.
