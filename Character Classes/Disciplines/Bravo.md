### [[Discipline A Abilities|A.]] Whirling Blade
Each time an attack targets only you, but misses, you gain +$1$ AC. This bonus resets to 0 when you take a short rest.

### [[Discipline B Abilities|B.]] Charming Bastard
Once per combat, when you miss an attack, grin and taunt your target. The nearest $L$+$1$ opponents roll Morale: On a success, they spend their turn moving to encircle you, but only the nearest opponent can attack you. If their attack(s) misses, you may use this ability again next round.

*($L$ is the number of levels you have taken in Swashbuckler.)*

### [[Discipline C Abilities|C.]] Sacrifice
When any source of damage would reduce you to 0 HP, you may sacrifice an adjacent ally to escape. That ally must **Save vs Death**: On a success, they take the damage instead of you. On a fail, they take damage instead of you, then take additional damage until their HP is equal to or lower than your HP.

Instead of rolling a Death Save, your ally may choose to die for you (regardless of whether the damage would actually kill them). If they do, immediately gain a level.

### [[Discipline D Abilities|D.]] Dangerous Reputation
When you leave your mark at the end of a battle, stories about you spread. If you return to your mark, the locals remember you and send an unreasonable number of people to attend to you.
