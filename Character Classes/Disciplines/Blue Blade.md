___
*You walk that thin line between heroism and folly, and never ask why. When you were just a shiftless bravo, a man spared your life, and you will make that act of kindness the foundation for a life of adventure for the Good. Devout but easy-going, you perform deeds that jaded soldiers call impossible.*

___
### [[Discipline A Abilities|A.]] Arrow Snatch
When an arrow, bullet, or other mundane missile would hit you, you may catch it from the air by rolling a Ranged Attack vs the result of the attack.

If both your hands are full, you’ll need to drop something to attempt this.

### [[Discipline A Abilities|A.]] Mark
Wounds you inflict on living creatures bleed blue. Your attacks deal +1d6 damage against foes already bleeding blue blood.

### [[Discipline B Abilities|B.]] Valour
When someone describes a challenge greater than anything you have accomplished, you may note it as your Purpose. Only one Purpose can be kept at a time, and you can never return to a Purpose that you previously abandoned.

If that challenge is overcome, your Purpose has been achieved. If you tell the story of that valorant adventure to a child, level up immediately.

### [[Discipline C Abilities|C.]] Sword Throwing
You may throw any bladed weapon up to 30’ without penalty, as if it were a ranged weapon.

### [[Discipline D Abilities|D.]] Quixoticism
If someone you’ve wounded survives combat with you, they must **Save vs Death**. If they fail, they become afflicted with a desire to live heroically and take needless risks. The next time they level up, they must level up as a Fighter in the Blue Blade discipline.
