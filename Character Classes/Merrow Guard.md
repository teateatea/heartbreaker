<!-- Based on the Legionnaire by A Distant Chime. -->

**A:** Formation, Detain<br>**B:** Battlefield Architect, Marching Orders<br>**C:** Heave-Ho!<br>**D:** Court of Adversity
___
### [[Discipline A Abilities|A.]] Formation
You gain +1 AC for each adjacent ally.

### [[Discipline A Abilities|A.]] Detain
Once per round, when a creature attempts to moves out of your attack range, you may immediately make a single attack against them. On a successful hit, they remain in place and immediately end their movement.

### [[Discipline B Abilities|B.]] Battlefield Architect
You know how to build barricades, palisades, trenches and ramparts, even without specialized equipment. With the right materials and a team of hands, you can build such structures quickly. *Subject to referee negotiation.*

### [[Discipline B Abilities|B.]] Marching Orders
You are exceptionally well-conditioned for marching in all sorts of terrain. Add fatigue for every two hexes traveled on foot, instead of each one.

### [[Discipline C Abilities|C.]] Heave-Ho!
Your throwing hand is unmatched. You automatically hit any target within 30’ when making a ranged attack with a javelin or spear.

### [[Discipline D Abilities|D.]] Court of Adversity
You stand alone with the same dignity as if you had a legion behind you. Carve a staff on vinewood for yourself, as a symbol of Saint Merrow.

While you can see an ally who is afraid, or unarmed and threatened, make all to-hit and damage rolls with advantage.
