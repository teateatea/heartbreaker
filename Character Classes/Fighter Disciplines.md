[[Fighter]]
___
Fighters choose a Discipline at 1st level, and gain relevant aspects and abilities based on that training. When the Fighter gains a Level, they progress to the next step of their Discipline: First **A**, then **B**, then **C**, and finally **D**.

Fighters may study multiple Disciplines, but only progress in one Discipline per Level, and cannot skip steps in any Discipline.

| [[Village Hero]] | You answered the call to action, and you intend to finish that call. No matter what happens, you’ll be different when you finally return to your home.                                                                        |
| [[Merrow Guard]] | You’ve entered the ranks of the Church of [[Saint Merrow - Strength & Passion\|Saint Merrow]], and as such, are guardian to the civilized. You represent a bastion of strength, passion, and perseverance against stagnation. |
| [[Dael Fighter]] | Boastful, loud, rash warriors for whom making as much noise as possible is both a battle tactic and a way of life. Whether raiding and pillaging or campaigning for a lord, you’ll be heard before you’re seen.               |

| [[Swordwife]]            | Dedicated to the study of combat, you take violent work as a means of developing your skill. You seldom have the clarity to realize that your relationship with your sword is more important than your relationship with any other person. |
| [[Bravo]]                | Your skill with a saber is only outmatched by your ability to induce ire in your hapless foes. You often bite off more than you can chew, but you'll stop at nothing to be recognized for your devilish escapades.                         |
