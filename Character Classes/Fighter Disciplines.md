[[Fighter]]
___
Fighters choose a Discipline at 1st level, and gain relevant aspects and abilities based on that training. When the Fighter gains a Level, they progress to the next step of their Discipline: First **A**, then **B**, then **C**, and finally **D**.

Fighters may study multiple Disciplines, but only progress in one Discipline per Level, and cannot skip steps in any Discipline.
